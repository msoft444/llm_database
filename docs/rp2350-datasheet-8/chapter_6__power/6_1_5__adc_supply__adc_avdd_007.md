# 6.1.5. ADC supply (ADC_AVDD)

6.1.5. ADC supply (ADC_AVDD)

ADC_AVDD supplies the chip’s Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC). It can be powered at a nominal voltage between 1.8 V

and 3.3 V, but the performance of the ADC will be compromised at voltages below 2.97 V. To reduce the number of

external power supplies, ADC_AVDD can use the same power source as the core voltage regulator analogue supply

(VREG_AVDD) or digital IO supply (IOVDD).

NOTE

It is safe to supply ADC_AVDD at a higher or lower voltage than IOVDD, e.g. to power the ADC at 3.3 V, for optimum

performance, while supporting 1.8 V signal levels on the digital IO. But the voltage on the ADC analogue inputs must

not exceed IOVDD, e.g. if IOVDD is powered at 1.8 V, the voltage on the ADC inputs should be limited to 1.8 V. Voltages

greater than IOVDD will result in leakage currents through the ESD protection diodes. See Section 14.9 for details.

ADC_AVDD should be decoupled with a 100nF capacitor close to the chip’s ADC_AVDD pin.
