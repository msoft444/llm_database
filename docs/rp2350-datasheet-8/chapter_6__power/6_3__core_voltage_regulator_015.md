# 6.3. Core voltage regulator

6.3. Core voltage regulator

RP2350 provides an on-chip voltage regulator for its digital core supply (DVDD). The regulator requires a 2.7 V to 5.5 V

input supply (VREG_VIN), allowing DVDD to be generated directly from a single lithium ion cell, or a USB power supply. A

separate, nominally 3.3 V, low noise supply (VREG_AVDD) is required for the regulator’s analogue control circuits. The

regulator supports both switching and linear modes of regulation, allowing efficient operation at both high and low

loads.

To allow the chip to start up, the regulator is enabled by default, and will power up as soon as its supplies are available.

The regulator starts in switching mode, with a nominal 1.1 V output, but its operating mode and output voltage can be

changed once the chip is out of reset. The output voltage can be set in the range 0.55 V to 3.30 V, and the regulator can

supply up to 200mA.

Although intended for the chip’s digital core supply (DVDD), the regulator can be used for other purposes if DVDD is

powered directly from an external power supply.
