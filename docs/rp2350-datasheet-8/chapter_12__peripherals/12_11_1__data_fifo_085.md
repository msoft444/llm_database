# 12.11.1. Data FIFO

12.11.1. Data FIFO

An 8-entry, 32-bit-wide FIFO buffers data between the system clock domain (clk_sys) and the HSTX clock domain

(clk_hstx). This is accessed through the AHB FASTPERI arbiter, providing single-cycle write access from the DMA. The

FIFO status is also available through this same bus interface, for faster polled processor IO; see Section 12.11.8.

The FIFO is accessed through a bus interface separate from the control registers (Section 12.11.7), which take multiple

cycles to access due to the asynchronous bus crossing. This design avoids incurring bus stalls on the system DMA or

the FASTPERI arbiter when accessing the FIFO.

The HSTX side also pops 32 bits at a time from the FIFO. The word data stream from the FIFO is optionally manipulated

by the command expander (Section 12.11.5) before being passed to the output shift register.
