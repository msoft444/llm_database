# 12.1. UART

12.1. UART

Arm documentation

Excerpted from the PrimeCell UART (PL011) Technical Reference Manual. Used with permission.

RP2350 has 2 identical instances of a UART peripheral, based on the Arm Primecell UART (PL011) (Revision r1p5).

Each instance supports the following features:

• Separate 32×8 TX and 32×12 RX FIFOs
• Programmable baud rate generator, clocked by clk_peri (see Figure 33)
• Standard asynchronous communication bits (start, stop, parity) added on transmit and removed on receive
• Line break detection
• Programmable serial interface (5, 6, 7, or 8 bits)
• 1 or 2 stop bits
• Programmable hardware flow control

Each UART can be connected to a number of GPIO pins as defined in the GPIO muxing table in Section 9.4. Connections

to the GPIO muxing use a prefix including the UART instance name uart0_ or uart1_, and include the following:

• Transmit data tx (referred to as UARTTXD in the following sections)
• Received data rx (referred to as UARTRXD in the following sections)
• Output flow control rts (referred to as nUARTRTS in the following sections)
• Input flow control cts (referred to as nUARTCTS in the following sections)

The modem mode and IrDA mode of the PL011 are not supported.

The UARTCLK is driven from clk_peri, and PCLK is driven from the system clock clk_sys (see Figure 33).
