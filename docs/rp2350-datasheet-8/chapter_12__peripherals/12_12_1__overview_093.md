# 12.12.1. Overview

12.12.1. Overview

RP2350 contains an Arm IP-based True Random Number Generator block. It supports the following features:

• Compliance with FIPS Publication 140-2, BSI AIS-31, and NIST SP 800-90B
• Produces approximately 7.5 kb/s of entropy when the core runs at 150 MHz

On request, the TRNG block generates a block of 192 entropy bits generated by automatically processing a series of

periodic samples from the TRNG block’s internal Ring Oscillator (ROSC).

RP2350 Datasheet

The TRNG block’s ROSC is a free-running oscillator with no direct connection to the system clocks on RP2350. As a

result, the ROSC generally runs asynchronously to the system clocks.

After a sufficient number of samples have been collected, the TRNG block completes the generation process and

presents the random number in the EHR_DATA[x] result registers.
