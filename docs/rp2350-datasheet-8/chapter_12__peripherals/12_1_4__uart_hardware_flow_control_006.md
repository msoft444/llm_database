# 12.1.4. UART hardware flow control

12.1.4. UART hardware flow control

The fully-selectable hardware flow control feature enables you to control the serial data flow with the nUARTRTS output

and nUARTCTS input signals. Figure 66 shows how to communicate between two devices using hardware flow control:

flow control between

two similar devices.

When the RTS flow control is enabled, nUARTRTS is asserted until the receive FIFO is filled up to the programmed

watermark level. When the CTS flow control is enabled, the transmitter can only transmit data when nUARTCTS is asserted.

The hardware flow control is selectable using the RTSEn and CTSEn bits in the Control Register, UARTCR. Table 1026 shows

how to configure UARTCR register bits to enable RTS and/or CTS.

NOTE

When RTS flow control is enabled, the software cannot use the RTSEn bit in the Control Register (UARTCR) to control

the status of nUARTRTS.

12.1.4.1. RTS flow control

The RTS flow control logic is linked to the programmable receive FIFO watermark levels.

When RTS flow control is disabled, the receive FIFO receives data until full, or no more data is transmitted to it.

When RTS flow control is enabled, the nUARTRTS is asserted until the receive FIFO fills up to the watermark level. When the

receive FIFO reaches the watermark level, the nUARTRTS signal is de-asserted. This indicates that the FIFO has no more

room to receive data. The transmission of data is expected to cease after the current character has been transmitted.

When the receive FIFO drains below the watermark level, the nUARTRTS signal is reasserted.

12.1.4.2. CTS flow control

The CTS flow control logic is linked to the nUARTCTS signal.

When CTS flow control is disabled, the transmitter transmits data until the transmit FIFO is empty.

When CTS flow control is enabled, the transmitter checks the nUARTCTS signal before transmitting each byte. It only

transmits the byte if the nUARTCTS signal is asserted. As long as the transmit FIFO is not empty and nUARTCTS is asserted,

data continues to transmit. If the transmit FIFO is empty and the nUARTCTS signal is asserted, no data is transmitted. If the

nUARTCTS signal is de-asserted during transmission, the transmitter finishes transmitting the current character before

stopping.
