# 12.15.2. SYSCFG

12.15.2. SYSCFG

12.15.2.1. Overview

The system config block controls miscellaneous chip settings, including:

• Check debug halt status of both cores
• Processor GPIO input synchroniser control (set to 1 to allow input synchroniser bypassing to reduce latency for

synchronous clocks)
• SWD interface control from inside the chip (allows one core to debug another, which may make debug connectivity

easier)
• State-retaining memory power down (SRAM periphery can be powered down when not in use to save a small

amount of power)

◦when powered down in this way, power is still applied to the SRAM storage array; use the Power Manager

(Chapter 6) to completely remove power
• Additional controls found in the AUXCTRL register

12.15.2.2. Changes from RP2040

• Moved the NMI mask to per-core registers in the EPPB (Section 3.7.5.1). The new registers reset on a processor

warm reset, which avoids issues with NMIs asserting during the bootrom early boot process.
• Expanded MEMPOWERDOWN to cover new memory banks
• Removed controls from DBGFORCE to account for the new single-DP debug topology

12.15.2.3. List of registers

The system config registers start at a base address of 0x40008000 (defined as SYSCFG_BASE in SDK).

| Offset | Name | Info |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x00 | PROC_CONFIG | Configuration for processors |
| 0x04 | PROC_IN_SYNC_BYPASS | For each bit, if 1, bypass the input synchronizer between that GPIO and the GPIO input register in the SIO. The input synchronizers should generally be unbypassed, to avoid injecting metastabilities into processors. If you’re feeling brave, you can bypass to save two cycles of input latency. This register applies to GPIO 0…31. |
| 0x08 | PROC_IN_SYNC_BYPASS_HI | For each bit, if 1, bypass the input synchronizer between that GPIO and the GPIO input register in the SIO. The input synchronizers should generally be unbypassed, to avoid injecting metastabilities into processors. If you’re feeling brave, you can bypass to save two cycles of input latency. This register applies to GPIO 32…47. USB GPIO 56..57 QSPI GPIO 58..63 |
| 0x0c | DBGFORCE | Directly control the chip SWD debug port |
| 0x10 | MEMPOWERDOWN | Control PD pins to memories. Set high to put memories to a low power state. In this state the memories will retain contents but not be accessible Use with caution |
| 0x14 | AUXCTRL | Auxiliary system control register |

PROC_CONFIG

Register

SYSCFG: PROC_IN_SYNC_BYPASS Register

Offset: 0x04

Description

For each bit, if 1, bypass the input synchronizer between that GPIO

and the GPIO input register in the SIO. The input synchronizers should

generally be unbypassed, to avoid injecting metastabilities into processors.

If you’re feeling brave, you can bypass to save two cycles of input

latency. This register applies to GPIO 0…31.

SYSCFG: AUXCTRL Register

Offset: 0x14

Description

Auxiliary system control register

| Bits | Description | Type | Reset |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 31:8 | Reserved. | - | - |
| 7:0 | * Bits 7:3: Reserved * Bit 2: Set to mask OTP power analogue power supply detection from resetting OTP controller and PSM * Bit 1: When clear, the LPOSC output is XORed into the TRNG ROSC output as an additional, uncorrelated entropy source. When set, this behaviour is disabled. * Bit 0: Force POWMAN clock to switch to LPOSC, by asserting its WDRESET input. This must be set before initiating a watchdog reset of the RSM from a stage that includes CLOCKS, if POWMAN is running from clk_ref at the point that the watchdog reset takes place. Otherwise, the short pulse generated on clk_ref by the reset of the CLOCKS block may affect POWMAN register state. | RW | 0x00 |
