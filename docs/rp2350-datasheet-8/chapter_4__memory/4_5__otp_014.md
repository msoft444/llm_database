# 4.5. OTP

4.5. OTP

RP2350 contains 8 kB of one-time-programmable storage (OTP), which stores:

• Manufacturing information such as unique device ID
• Boot configuration such as non-default crystal oscillator frequency
• Public key fingerprint(s) for boot signature enforcement
• Symmetric keys for decryption of external flash contents into SRAM
• User-defined contents, including bootable program images (Section 5.10.7)

The OTP storage is structured as 4096 × 24-bit rows. Each row contains 16 bits of data and 8 bits of parity information,

providing 8 kB of data storage. OTP bit cells are initially 0 and can be programmed to 1. However, they cannot be cleared

back to 0 under any circumstance. This ensures that security-critical flags, such as debug disables, are physically

impossible to clear once set. However, you must also take care to program the correct values.

For more information about the OTP subsystem, see Chapter 13.
