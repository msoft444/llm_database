# 2.1.2. Bus security filtering

2.1.2. Bus security filtering

Every point where the fabric connects to a downstream AHB or APB peripheral is interposed by a bus security filter,

which enforces the following access control lists as defined by the ACCESSCTRL registers (Section 10.6):

• A list of who can access the port: core 0, core 1, DMA, debugger
• A list of the security states from which the port can be accessed: the four combinations of Secure/Non-secure and

Privileged/Unprivileged.

Accesses that fail either check are prevented from accessing the downstream port, and return a bus error upstream.

There are three exceptions, which do not implement bus security filters because they implement their own security

filtering internally:

• The ACCESSCTRL block itself, which is always world-readable, but filters writes on security and privilege
• Boot RAM, which is hardwired to Secure access only
• The single-cycle IO subsystem (SIO), which is internally banked over Secure and Non-secure

The Cortex-M Private Peripheral Bus (PPB) registers also lack ACCESSCTRL permissions because they are internal to

the processors, not accessed through the system bus. The PPB registers are internally banked over Secure and Non-

secure.
