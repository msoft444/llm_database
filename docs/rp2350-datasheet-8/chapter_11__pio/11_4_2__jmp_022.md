11.4.2.2. Operation

Set program counter to Address if Condition is true, otherwise no operation.

Delay cycles on a JMP always take effect, whether Condition is true or false, and they take place after Condition is

evaluated and the program counter is updated.

• Condition:

◦000: (no condition): Always

◦001: !X: scratch X zero

◦010: X--: scratch X non-zero, prior to decrement

◦011: !Y: scratch Y zero

◦100: Y--: scratch Y non-zero, prior to decrement

◦101: X!=Y: scratch X not equal scratch Y

◦110: PIN: branch on input pin

◦111: !OSRE: output shift register not empty
• Address: Instruction address to jump to. In the instruction encoding this is an absolute address within the PIO

instruction memory

JMP PIN branches on the GPIO selected by EXECCTRL_JMP_PIN, a configuration field which selects one out of the maximum

of 32 GPIO inputs visible to a state machine, independently of the state machine’s other input mapping. The branch is

taken if the GPIO is high.

!OSRE compares the bits shifted out since the last PULL with the shift count threshold configured by SHIFTCTRL_PULL_THRESH.

This is the same threshold used by autopull (Section 11.5.4).

JMP X-- and JMP Y-- always decrement scratch register X or Y, respectively. The decrement is not conditional on the

current value of the scratch register. The branch is conditioned on the initial value of the register, i.e. before the

decrement took place: if the register is initially nonzero, the branch is taken.

11.4.2.3. Assembler syntax

```c
jmp (<cond>) <target>
```

RP2350 Datasheet

| <cond> | An optional condition listed above (e.g. !x for scratch X zero). If a condition code is not specified, the branch is always taken. |
| --- | --- |
| <target> | A program label or value (see Section 11.3.2) representing instruction offset within the program (the first instruction being offset 0). Because the PIO JMP instruction uses absolute addresses in the PIO instruction memory, JMPs need to be adjusted based on the program load offset at runtime. This is handled for you when loading a program with the SDK, but care should be taken when encoding JMP instructions for use by OUT EXEC. |
