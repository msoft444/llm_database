# 11.2. Programmer’s model

11.2. Programmer’s model

The four state machines execute from shared instruction memory. System software loads programs into this memory,

configures the state machines and IO mapping, and then sets the state machines running. PIO programs come from

various sources: assembled directly by the user, drawn from the PIO library, or generated programmatically by user

software.

From this point on, state machines are generally autonomous, and system software interacts through DMA, interrupts

and control registers, as with other peripherals on RP2350. For more complex interfaces, PIO provides a small but

flexible set of primitives which allow system software to be more hands-on with state machine control flow.

Figure 45. State

machine overview.

Data flows in and out

through a pair of

FIFOs. The state

machine executes a

program which

transfers data

between these FIFOs,

a set of internal

registers, and the pins.

The clock divider can

reduce the state

machine’s execution

speed by a constant

factor.
