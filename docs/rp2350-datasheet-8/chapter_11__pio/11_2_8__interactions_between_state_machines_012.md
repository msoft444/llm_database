11.2.8. Interactions between state machines

Instruction memory is implemented as a 1-write, 4-read register file, allowing all four state machines to read an

instruction on the same cycle without stalling.

There are three ways to apply the multiple state machines:

• Pointing multiple state machines at the same program
• Pointing multiple state machines at different programs
• Using multiple state machines to run different parts of the same interface, e.g. TX and RX side of a UART, or

clock/hsync and pixel data on a DPI display

State machines cannot communicate data, but they can synchronise with one another by using the IRQ flags. There are

8 flags total. Each state machine can set or clear any flag using the IRQ instruction, and can wait for a flag to go high or

low using the WAIT IRQ instruction. This allows cycle-accurate synchronisation between state machines.
