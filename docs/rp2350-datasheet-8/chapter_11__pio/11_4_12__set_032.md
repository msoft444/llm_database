• Data: 5-bit immediate value to drive to pins or register.

This can be used to assert control signals such as a clock or chip select, or to initialise loop counters. As Data is 5 bits in

size, scratch registers can be SET to values from 0-31, which is sufficient for a 32-iteration loop.

The mapping of SET and OUT onto pins is configured independently. They may be mapped to distinct locations, for

example if one pin is to be used as a clock signal, and another for data. They may also be overlapping ranges of pins: a

UART transmitter might use SET to assert start and stop bits, and OUT instructions to shift out FIFO data to the same pins.

11.4.12.3. Assembler syntax

```c
set <destination>, <value>
```

where:

| <destination> | Is one of the destinations specified above. |
| --- | --- |
| <value> | The value (see Section 11.3.2) to set (valid range 0-31). |
