# 3.5.6. Self-hosted debug

3.5.6. Self-hosted debug

All APs shown in Figure 10, except for the RP-AP, have direct memory-mapped access from the system bus. This is

known as self-hosted debug, because with care it allows running a debug host (i.e. a debugger) directly on-system. It

can also be used to access the trace hardware, which can be used for self-hosted trace using the trace DMA FIFO. By

default only Secure access is permitted, as the processor debug presents an opportunity for Non-secure code to

interfere with the Secure context and/or perform Secure bus accesses.

The self-hosted debug window starts at address 0x40140000 (CORESIGHT_PERIPH_BASE). The offsets of the APs within

this window are the same as the APs' addresses when accessed from the SW-DP.

Because of the blocking nature of the AHB-AP’s DRW register, and its interactions with the Cortex-M33’s arbitration of

AHB-AP accesses with load/stores, certain accesses have potential to cause bus lockup due to circular bus stall

dependencies. In particular, cores may not access their own AHB-APs through the self-hosted debug window, and AHB-

APs may not access AHB-APs through the self-hosted debug window — attempting to do so will immediately return a

bus fault. To reduce the opportunities for deadlock, a full APB crossbar is used to connect the SW-DP and the self-

hosted debug port to the APs, so that for example self-hosted use of the Arm trace hardware will not interfere with an

external debugger attaching via the AHB-APs.

RP2350 Datasheet

There are some cases where a bus deadlock can not be avoided, such as a core using the other core’s AHB-AP, via the

self-hosted debug window, to access some other APB peripheral:

1. The access upstream of the APB’s DRW register will not complete until the downstream access completes

2. The downstream access will not complete until it is granted access to the system APB bridge

3. Access to the APB bridge will not be granted until the upstream access, which is occupying the system APB bridge,

completes

4. See point 1.

This situation can arise when running a self-hosted debugger on one core, and debugging code on the other core which

accesses APB addresses. The deadlock is eventually broken when the APB bridge’s 65536-cycle timeout expires,

abandoning the transfer and returning a bus error to the origin of the upstream access. To avoid this, software should

detect when it is about to use an AP to access an APB address (an address starting with 0x4), and perform the access

directly instead of using the Mem-AP.

This type of deadlock does not occur when the debugger accesses the bus with RISC-V System Bus Access, because

the bus transfer upstream of the DM does not block on completion of the downstream access.
