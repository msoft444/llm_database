floor(log2(nonvolatile / 128 kB))

Type of core (e.g. Cortex-M33)

The post-fix numeral on RP2350 comes from the following,

1. Number of processor cores

◦2 indicates a dual-core system

2. Loosely which type of processor

◦3 indicates Cortex-M33 or Hazard3

3. Internal memory capacity: 

◦5 indicates at least 25 × 16 kB = 512 kB

◦RP2350 has 520 kB of main system SRAM

4. Internal storage capacity: 
 (or 0 if no onboard nonvolatile storage)
