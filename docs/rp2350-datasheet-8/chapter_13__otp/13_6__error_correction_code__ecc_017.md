# 13.6. Error Correction Code (ECC)

13.6. Error Correction Code (ECC)

ECC-protected rows store data in the following structure, accessible through a raw alias:

• Bits 23:22: bit repair by polarity (BRP) flag
• Bits 21:16: modified Hamming ECC code
• Bits 15:0 (the 16 LSBs): data

RP2350 stores the following error correction data in the 8 MSBs of each 24-bit row:

• a 6-bit modified Hamming code ECC, providing single-error-correct and double-error-detect capabilities
• 2 bits of bit repair by polarity (BRP), which supports inverting the entire row at programming time to repair a single

set bit that should be clear

Writes first encode ECC, then BRP. Reads first decode BRP, then ECC. When reading through an ECC data alias (Section

13.1), hardware performs correction transparently. ECC programming operations (writes) automatically generate ECC

bits when you use the bootrom otp_access API (Section 5.4.8.21).

ECC is not suitable for data that mutates one bit at a time, since the ECC value is derived from the entire 16-bit data

value. When storing data without ECC, use another form of redundancy, such as 3-way majority vote.
