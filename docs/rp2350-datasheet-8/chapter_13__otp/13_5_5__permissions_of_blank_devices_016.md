# 13.5.5. Permissions of blank devices

13.5.5. Permissions of blank devices

Each RP2350 device has some information programmed during manufacturing test. At this time, a small number of

hard page lock bits are also programmed:

RP2350 Datasheet

• Page 0, which contains chip information, is read-only for all accesses.
• Pages 1 and 2, which contain boot config and boot key fingerprints, are read-only for Non-secure access, read-

write for Secure access, and read-write for bootloader access.
• Page 62, which contains only the page 62 lock word, is read-only for Non-secure access, read-write for Secure

access, and read-write for bootloader access (as a partial workaround for RP2350-E28).
• Page 63, which contains the RMA flag, is read-only for Non-secure and bootloader access, and read-write for

Secure access.

This minimal set of default permissions on blank devices avoids certain classes of security model violation, like Non-

secure code being able to brick the chip by overwriting the boot key fingerprints with invalid data. In this context, the

term blank device refers to a device that has gone through manufacturing test programming, but has not had any other

OTP bits programmed by the user.

You can add additional soft or hard locks to these default permissions, with the exception of page 0. Page 0 cannot be

hard-locked, since the secure read-only permission prevents a user from altering its lock word.

Lock words 2 through 61, covering all pages with user-defined contents, are left unprogrammed. On a blank device,

these pages are fully accessible from all domains. Before launching any Non-secure application, you should apply at

least a soft read-only lock to all pages that are not explicitly allocated for Non-secure use. To do this, write to

SW_LOCK2 through SW_LOCK61. For devices that you don’t expect to RMA, such as those that have passed board-level

manufacturing tests, you should lock secure writes to the RMA flag.
