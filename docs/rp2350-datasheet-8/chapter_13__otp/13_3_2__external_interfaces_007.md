# 13.3.2. External interfaces

13.3.2. External interfaces

The OTP integration has one upstream APB interface, which splits internally onto two separate interfaces. This

guarantees the hardware only serves a single upstream APB access at a time, with a single PPROT security level.

The first APB interface is the data interface (or data bridge) (OTPD). It has the following characteristics:

• Read-only
• Connects to the Synopsys device access port (DAP)
• Data interface reads always return 32 or 24 bits of valid data
• The data interface address is rounded down to a multiple of 32 bits, so that narrow reads return the correct byte

lanes
• There is an 8 kB window which supports 32-bit ECC reads

◦Each upstream bus read is split into two OTP accesses, each of which returns 16 bits of error-corrected data

from the OTP
• There is an 8 kB window which supports guarded 32-bit ECC reads, and returns a bus error if the guarding read

fails.

◦Functions the same as the ECC read window, but reads the Synopsys boot word before accessing the OTP

array, and return a bus error if the first read does not match the expected constant

◦Used to increase confidence in software OTP reads in the bootrom
• There is a 16 kB window which supports 24-bit raw reads

◦Each access returns a single raw 24-bit OTP row, bypassing error correction

◦Software must provide its own redundancy (e.g. triple majority vote)

◦Allows bit-mutable data structures, such as boot flags, or thermometer counters

The second APB interface is the command interface. This provides two main functions:

• Provides a bridge to the SBPI interface (Synopsys proprietary Serial and Byte-Parallel Interface bus)

◦SBPI connects to the Programmable Master Controller (PMC), with access to the DAP, DATAPATH, charge

pump (IPS), and fuse memory (SHF)

◦Allows arbitrary OTP operations, including programming

◦Only accessible to Secure reads and writes
• Provides control registers for Raspberry Pi hardware

◦Registers have different accessibility according to Secure/Non-secure and read/write

◦Software lock registers are always readable by both security domains

Hardware configuration data read from OTP during the power-up sequence drives system-level control signals, e.g.

disabling CoreSight APs. This is described in more detail in (Section 13.3.4).

A single system-level interrupt output (IRQ) generates interrupts for the following sources:

• Secure read failed due to locks
• Non-secure read failed due to locks
• Write failed due to locks
• SBPI FLAG, used by the PMC to signal completion
• Data port access when DCTRL is set error

◦USR.DCTRL tells the SNPS AP whether the SBPI bridge or data bridge can access the memory array; this help

debugging SW if a data access is attempted whilst the DAP is inaccessible

Any failed access also returns a bus fault (PSLVERR). To determine whether an OTP address is accessible, query the lock

tables.

Non-secure code cannot access the interrupt status registers.
