# 13.8. Imaging Vulnerability

13.8. Imaging Vulnerability

The RP2350 OTP is intended to store boot key fingerprints and boot decryption keys. The ability to protect encrypted

contents in external flash storage depends on the ability to protect the OTP contents from unauthorised or external

reads. The OTP uses antifuse bit cells, which store data as a charge, similar to a flash bit cell. They do not make use of

a physical structural change as used in a traditional fuse cell. This makes them resistant to many imaging techniques,

such as optical and scanning electron microscopy. However antifuse cells can be imaged using a novel technique

called passive voltage contrast (PVC), using a focused ion beam (FIB) device.

This process involves decapsulating the die. Therefore physical access to the device is a strict requirement, and there is

a moderate chance of destroying the die without being able to recover its OTP contents.
