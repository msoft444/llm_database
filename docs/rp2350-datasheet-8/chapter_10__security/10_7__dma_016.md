# 10.7. DMA

10.7. DMA

The RP2350 system DMA is a peripheral which performs arbitrary reads and writes on memory. This means that, as

with a processor, care is necessary to maintain isolation between memory or peripherals owned by different security

domains. Any given processor context must not access memory or peripherals belonging to a more secure context. The

DMA helps maintain this invariant by ensuring software can not use the DMA to access a more secure context on its

behalf, including such cases as a processor programming the DMA to program the DMA.

RP2350 extends the processor security/privilege states to individual DMA channels, and the DMA filters its own

memory accesses with a built-in memory protection unit (MPU) similarly capable to the Armv8-M SAU or the RISC-V

PMP. When correctly configured, this allows multiple security domains to transparently and safely share DMA

resources. It is also possible to assign the entire DMA block wholesale to a single security domain using the

ACCESSCTRL registers (Section 10.6) if this fine-grained configuration is not desired.

This section gives an overview of the DMA’s security features. The specific hardware details are documented in Section

12.6.6.
