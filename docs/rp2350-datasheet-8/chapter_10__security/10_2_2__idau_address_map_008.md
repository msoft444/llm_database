# 10.2.2. IDAU address map

10.2.2. IDAU address map

The Cortex-M33 provides an implementation-defined attribution unit (IDAU) interface, which allows system

implementers such as Raspberry Pi Ltd to augment the security attribution map defined by the SAU. The RP2350 IDAU

is a hardwired address decode network, with no user configuration. Its address map is as follows:

| Start (hex) | End (hex) | Contents | IDAU Attribute |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 00000000 | 000042ff | Arm boot | Exempt |
| 00004300 | 00007dff | USB/RISC-V boot | Non-secure (instruction fetch), Exempt (load/store) |
| 00007e00 | 00007fff | Bootrom SGs | Secure and Non-secure-Callable |
| 10000000 | 1fffffff | XIP | Non-secure |
| 20000000 | 20081fff | SRAM | Non-secure |
| 40000000 | 4fffffff | APB | Exempt |
| 50000000 | 5fffffff | AHB | Exempt |
| d0000000 | dfffffff | SIO | Exempt |

Exempt regions are not checked by the processor against its current security state. Effectively, the processor considers

these regions Secure when the processor is in the Secure state, and Non-secure when the processor is in the Non-

secure state.

Peripherals are marked Exempt because you’re expected to assign them to security domains using the controls in

ACCESSCTRL (Section 10.6). This approach avoids relying on SAU regions, which are too limited for meaningful

peripheral assignment, and eliminates the need for separate Secure and Non-secure peripheral mirrors, which can

cause programming errors.

The SIO is marked Exempt because it is internally banked over Secure and Non-secure based on the bus access’s

security attribute, which generally matches the processor’s current security state.

As peripherals are Exempt, RP2350 forbids processor instruction fetch from peripherals, by physically disconnecting the

bus. Processors fail to fetch instructions from peripherals even if the default MPU permissions are overridden to allow

execute permission. Exempt regions permit both Secure and Non-secure access, and TrustZone-M forbids the

combination of Non-secure-writable and Secure-executable, so this is a necessary restriction. The same consideration

does not apply to the bootrom as the ROM is physically immutable.

The first part of the bootrom is Exempt, because it contains routines expected to be called by both Secure and Non-

secure software in cases where it may not be desirable for Non-secure code to elevate through a Secure Gateway. An

example of this is the bootrom memcpy() implementation. Code in the Exempt ROM region is hardened against return-

oriented programming (ROP) attacks using the redundancy coprocessor’s stack canary instructions.

After a certain watermark, which may vary depending on ROM revision, the ROM becomes IDAU-Non-secure for the

purpose of instruction fetch. If an Non-secure SAU region is placed over the bootrom (which is expected to be the case

in general, to get the correct NSC attribute on the Secure Gateway region), this part of the ROM becomes non-

executable to Secure code. Consequently, this part of the bootrom is not ROP-hardened. This part of the ROM contains

the NSBOOT (including USB boot) implementation, as well as a RISC-V Armv6-M emulator that can be used to emulate

most of the bootrom on RISC-V processors. This region is only implemented on the instruction-side IDAU query: this is

an implementation detail that improves timing on the load/store IDAU query, and does not have security implications

(given the mask ROM is inherently unwritable) other than that the tt instruction will not be aware of this region.

The final 512 bytes of the bootrom has the Secure, Non-secure-Callable (NSC) attribute. This means it contains entry

points for Non-secure calls into Secure code. Note that for this IDAU-defined attribute to take effect, the SAU-defined

attribute for this range must also be NSC or lower. The recommended configuration is a single Non-secure SAU region

covering the entirety of the bootrom. The bootrom exits into user code with the SAU enabled, and SAU region 7 active

and covering the entirety of the bootrom.

XIP and SRAM are Non-secure in the IDAU, as they are expected to be divided using the SAU. When the SAU and IDAU

differ, if the IDAU attribute is not Exempt, the processor takes whichever is greater out of the SAU and IDAU attribute, in

the order Secure > Non-secure-Callable > Non-secure.

Addresses not listed in this table are not decoded by the system AHB crossbar, and will return bus faults if accessed. In

these ranges, the ROM’s IDAU map is mirrored every 32 kB up to 0x0fffffff. The remaining addresses in the IDAU are

Non-secure.
