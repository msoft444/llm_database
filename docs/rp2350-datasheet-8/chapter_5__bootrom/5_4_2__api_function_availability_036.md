# 5.4.2. API function availability

5.4.2. API function availability

Some functions are not available under all architectures or security levels. The API listing in Section 5.4.6 uses the

following terms to list the availability of each individual API entry point:

Arm-S

The function is available to Secure Arm code. The majority of functions are available for Arm-S unless they deal

specifically with RISC-V or Non-secure functionality.

RISC-V

The function is available to RISC-V code. Most of the functions that are available under Arm-S are also exposed

under RISC-V unless they deal specifically with Arm security states.

Arm-NS

The function is available to Non-secure Arm code. The function in this case performs additional permission and

argument checks to prevent Secure data from leaking or being corrupted.

Each individual Arm-NS API function must be explicitly enabled by Secure code before use, via set_ns_api_permission(). A

disabled Non-secure API returns BOOTROM_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED if disabled by Secure code. All Non-secure APIs are

disabled initially. There is no permission control on Non-secure code calling Secure-only Arm-S functions, but such a call

will crash when it attempts to access Secure-only hardware.

The Arm-NS functions may escalate through a Secure Gateway (SG) instruction to allow Non-secure code to perform

limited operations on nominally Secure-only hardware, such as QSPI direct-mode interface used for flash programming.

The RISC-V functions do not have separate entry points based on privilege level. Both M-mode and U-mode software can

call bootrom APIs, assuming they have execute permissions on ROM addresses in the PMP. However, U-mode calls will

crash if they attempt to access M-mode-only hardware.
