RP2350 Datasheet

Appendix B: Units used in this
document

This datasheet follows standard practice for use of SI units as recommended by NIST, except in the context of memory

and storage capacity. Here it adopts the convention that the prefixes k (kilo), M (mega) and G (giga) always refer to the

nearest power of two to their standard decimal value. This aligns the datasheet with common usage for these units.
