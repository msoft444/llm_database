RP2350-E2

| Reference | RP2350-E2 |

| Summary | SIO SPINLOCK writes are mirrored at +0x80 offset |
| Affects | RP2350 A2, RP2350 A3, RP2350 A4 |
| Description | The SIO contains spinlock registers, SPINLOCK0 through SPINLOCK31. Reading a spinlock register attempts to claim it, returning nonzero if the claim was successful and 0 if unsuccessful. Writing to a spinlock register releases it, so the next claim will be successful. SIO spinlock registers are at register offsets 0x100 through 0x17c within SIO. RP2350 adds new SIO registers at register offsets 0x180 and above: Doorbells, the PERI_NONSEC register, the RISC-V soft IRQ register, the RISC-V MTIME registers, and the TMDS encoder. The SIO address decoder detects writes to spinlocks by decoding on bit 8 of the address. This means writes in the range 0x180 through 0x1fc are spuriously detected as writes to the corresponding spinlock address 128 bytes below, in the range 0x100 through 0x17c. Writing to any of these high registers will set the corresponding lock to the unclaimed state. This erratum only affects writes to the spinlock registers. Reads are correctly decoded, so aren’t affected by accesses above 0x17c. |
| Workaround | Use processor atomic instructions instead of the SIO spinlocks. The SDK hardware sync spin lock library _ _ _ uses software lock variables by default when building for RP2350, instead of hardware spinlocks. The following SIO spinlocks can be used normally because they don’t alias with writable registers: 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 18 through 31. Some of the other lock addresses may be used safely depending on which of the high-addressed SIO registers are in use. Locks 18 through 24 alias with some read-only TMDS encoder registers, which is safe as only writes are mis-decoded. |
