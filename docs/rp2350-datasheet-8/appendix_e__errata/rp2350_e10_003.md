# RP2350-E10

RP2350-E10

| Reference | RP2350-E10 |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | UF2 drag-and-drop doesn’t work with partition tables |
| Affects | RP2350 A2 |
| Description | When dragging and dropping a UF2 onto the USB Mass Storage Device, the bootrom on chip revision A2 doesn’t set up the flash before checking the partition table. This causes the UF2 download to fail if there is a partition table present. |
| Workaround | Add a single block at the start of the UF2 with an Absolute family ID, targeting the end of Flash, with block number set to 0 and number of blocks set to 2. This block is written to flash first but doesn’t reboot the device, and sets up the flash for the rest of the UF2 to be downloaded correctly. This is handled for you automatically by picotool in the SDK, which adds this block when generating UF2s if the --abs-block flag is specified. This workaround means that the last block of flash is erased when downloading such a UF2, which could overwrite user data. As of picotool version 2.1.0, this additional UF2 block is marked with a Raspberry Pi specific UF2 extension UF2 EXTENSION RP2 IGNORE BLOCK (0x9957e304). The RP2350 A3 and later bootroms, contain a fix for _ _ _ _ this erratum, and therefore don’t need the workaround. The presence of this extension in the UF2 block allows the newer RP2350 to recognize and ignore the workaround block, thus avoiding the risk of overwriting user data. |
