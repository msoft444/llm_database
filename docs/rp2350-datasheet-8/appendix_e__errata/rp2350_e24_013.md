# RP2350-E24

RP2350-E24

| Reference | RP2350-E24 |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | An attacker with physical access to the chip, moderate hardware, and the ability to physically "glitch" the CPU at precise times, could cause unsigned code execution on a secured RP2350. |
| Affects | RP2350 A2, RP2350 A3 |
| Description | An attacker with physical access to the chip, and the ability to switch the contents of "flash" as read by the RP2350 over QSPI during boot at precise times, could, combined with a precisely-timed physical "glitch" attack of the CPU, trick the bootrom into checking the signature of data other than the program binary as loaded into memory during secure boot. If this "other" data passes the signature check, then the attacker’s binary is executed without itself having passed a signature check, which allows the user to run arbitrary unsigned code on the RP2350. |
