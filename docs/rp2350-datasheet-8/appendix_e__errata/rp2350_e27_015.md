| Summary | Bus priority controls apply to wrong managers for APB and FASTPERI arbiters. |
| Affects | RP2350 A2, RP2350 A3, RP2350 A4 |
| Description | RP2350 bus fabric consists mainly of an AHB5 crossbar, where 6 upstream ports (managers) are routed to 15 downstream crossbar ports. Figure 5 shows the overall structure of the bus fabric, including this crossbar. Because there can be multiple accesses to a given downstream crossbar port on any one cycle, an arbiter circuit selects one transfer to forward to the downstream port, and stalls all other transfers targeting this port. The BUSCTRL BUS_PRIORITY register controls these arbiter circuits. It configures a 1-bit priority level for each of the following four groups of AHB5 managers: • DMA write • DMA read • Core 0 instruction fetch and core 0 load/store • Core 1 instruction fetch and core 1 load/store Accesses from high-priority managers are always routed preferentially over those from low-priority managers. Multiple accesses from managers of the same priority are processed one at a time, taking turns in a repeating cycle (round-robin arbitration). On the FASTPERI and APB arbiters, these signals are mis-wired, such that the wrong managers are prioritised: • BUS_PRIORITY.PROC0 controls DMA write priority • BUS_PRIORITY.PROC1 controls core 0 load/store priority • BUS_PRIORITY.DMA_R controls core 1 load/store priority • BUS_PRIORITY.DMA_W controls DMA read priority The BUS_PRIORITY controls are applied correctly for all other arbiters: ROM, SRAM, and XIP. For example, if the DMA R and DMA W bits were set, this would prioritise DMA over processor access to ROM, _ _ SRAM, and XIP. However, peripheral access would prioritise DMA read and core 1 load/store over DMA write and core 0 load/store. |
| Workaround | There is no complete fix, but the necessary prioritisation can often still be achieved by configuring BUS_PRIORITY for correct priority at the peripherals, and then arranging buffers in SRAM to minimise contention, such as using SRAM8 or SRAM9 as processor-private memories. Also consider the following approaches: • Split RAM access across the SRAM0 to SRAM3 and SRAM4 to SRAM7 striped regions to further reduce RAM contention. • Try to reduce overall peripheral bandwidth demand by using wider accesses for peripherals that support it. For example, SPI supports 16-bit data, and HSTX and PIO support 32-bit data. • Avoid processor polling of peripheral status registers. Instead, use interrupts or DMA DREQ signals. • Assess whether the default round-robin arbitration performs better than the reachable asymmetric priority configurations. |
