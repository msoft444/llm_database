12.15.2.1. Overview

The system config block controls miscellaneous chip settings, including:

• Check debug halt status of both cores
• Processor GPIO input synchroniser control (set to 1 to allow input synchroniser bypassing to reduce latency for

synchronous clocks)
• SWD interface control from inside the chip (allows one core to debug another, which may make debug connectivity

easier)
• State-retaining memory power down (SRAM periphery can be powered down when not in use to save a small

amount of power)

◦when powered down in this way, power is still applied to the SRAM storage array; use the Power Manager

(Chapter 6) to completely remove power
• Additional controls found in the AUXCTRL register

12.15.2.2. Changes from RP2040

• Moved the NMI mask to per-core registers in the EPPB (Section 3.7.5.1). The new registers reset on a processor

warm reset, which avoids issues with NMIs asserting during the bootrom early boot process.
• Expanded MEMPOWERDOWN to cover new memory banks
• Removed controls from DBGFORCE to account for the new single-DP debug topology

12.15.2.3. List of registers

The system config registers start at a base address of 0x40008000 (defined as SYSCFG_BASE in SDK).
