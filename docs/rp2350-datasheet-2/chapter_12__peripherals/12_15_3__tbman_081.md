Description

Auxiliary system control register

| Bits | Description | Type | Reset |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 31:8 | Reserved. | - | - |
| 7:0 | * Bits 7:3: Reserved
* Bit 2: Set to mask OTP power analogue power supply detection from
resetting OTP controller and PSM
* Bit 1: When clear, the LPOSC output is XORed into the TRNG ROSC output as
an additional, uncorrelated entropy source. When set, this behaviour is
disabled.
* Bit 0: Force POWMAN clock to switch to LPOSC, by asserting its WDRESET
input. This must be set before initiating a watchdog reset of the RSM from a
stage that includes CLOCKS, if POWMAN is running from clk_ref at the point
that the watchdog reset takes place. Otherwise, the short pulse generated on
clk_ref by the reset of the CLOCKS block may affect POWMAN register state. | RW | 0x00 |

12.15.3. TBMAN

TBMAN refers to the testbench manager, used during chip development simulations to verify the design. During these

simulations TBMAN allows software running on RP2350 to control the testbench and simulation environment. On the

real chip, it has no effect other than providing a single PLATFORM register that indicates that this is the real chip. This

PLATFORM functionality is duplicated in the sysinfo (Section 12.15.1) registers.
