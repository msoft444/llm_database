Arm Documentation

Excerpted from the ARM PrimeCell Synchronous Serial Port (PL022) Technical Reference Manual. Used

with permission.

RP2350 has two identical SPI controllers, both based on an Arm Primecell Synchronous Serial Port (SSP) (PL022)

(Revision r1p4). This is distinct from the QSPI memory interface covered in Section 12.14.

Each controller supports the following features:

• Master or Slave modes

◦Motorola SPI-compatible interface

◦Texas Instruments synchronous serial interface

◦National Semiconductor Microwire interface
• 8-location TX and RX FIFOs
• Interrupt generation to service FIFOs or indicate error conditions
• Can be driven from DMA
• Programmable clock rate
• Programmable data size 4-16 bits

Each controller can be connected to a number of GPIO pins as defined in the Bank 0 GPIO function table, Table 646

(Section 9.4).

The entries in the GPIO function table, such as "SPI0 TX", specify the SPI instance and the SPI signal for that instance

which are available on that GPIO. The signals in the table are described as:

SCK

Serial clock. Connects to the SPI peripheral clock signals described as SSPCLKOUT and SSPCLKIN in the following

sections. These pins are inputs in slave mode, and outputs in master mode.

TX

Serial data output. Connects to the SPI peripheral SSPTXD (data out) and nSSPOE (output enable) signals described in

the following sections. This is always a data output, independent of the bus role. The SPI peripheral controls

tristating depending on chip select status.

RX

Serial data input. Connects to the SPI peripheral SSPRXD data input described in the following sections. This is always

a data input, independent of the bus role.

CSn

Active-low chip select. Connects to the SPI peripheral signals SSPFSSOUT and SSPFSSIN described in the followinsg

sections. These pins are inputs in slave mode, and outputs in master mode.

The SPI uses clk_peri as its reference clock for SPI timing, and is referred to as SSPCLK in the following sections. clk_sys

is used as the bus clock, and is referred to as PCLK in the following sections (also see Figure 33).
