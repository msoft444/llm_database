12.6. DMA

The RP2350 Direct Memory Access (DMA) controller performs bulk data transfers on a processor’s behalf. This leaves

processors free to attend to other tasks or enter low-power sleep states. The DMA dual bus manager ports can issue

one read and one write access per cycle. The data throughput is therefore far greater than one of RP2350’s processors.
