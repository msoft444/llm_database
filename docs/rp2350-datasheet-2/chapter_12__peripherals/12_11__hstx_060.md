RP2350 Datasheet

For example, suppose 1μsec timer precision is required. The user could supply an external 2-25MHz clock in place of

the LPOSC and program both the LPOSC and XOSC frequency registers in MHz units rather than kHz. The maximum

frequency of the external clock is 29MHz.

12.10.9. List of registers

The AON Timer shares a register address space with the power management subsystems in the always-on domain. The

address space is referred to as POWMAN elsewhere in this document and a complete list of POWMAN registers is provided in

Section 6.4. The registers associated with the AON Timer are:

• SET_TIME_63TO48
• SET_TIME_47TO32
• SET_TIME_31TO16
• SET_TIME_15TO0
• READ_TIME_UPPER
• READ_TIME_LOWER
• ALARM_TIME_63TO48
• ALARM_TIME_47TO32
• ALARM_TIME_31TO16
• ALARM_TIME_15TO0
• TIMER

12.11. HSTX

The high-speed serial transmit (HSTX) streams data from the system clock domain to up to 8 GPIOs at a rate

independent of the system clock. On RP2350, GPIOs 12 through 19 are HSTX-capable. HSTX is output-only.

Registers

HSTX drives data through GPIOs using DDR output registers to transfer up to two bits per clock cycle per pin. The HSTX

balances all delays to GPIO outputs within 300 picoseconds, minimising common-mode components when using

neighbouring GPIOs as a pseudo-differential driver. This also helps maintain destination setup and hold time when a

clock is driven alongside the output data.

The maximum frequency for the HSTX clock is 150 MHz, the same as the system clock. With DDR output operation, this
