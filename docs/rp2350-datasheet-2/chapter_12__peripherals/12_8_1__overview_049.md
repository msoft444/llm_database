USB: DEV_SM_WATCHDOG Register

Offset: 0x114

Description

Watchdog that forces the device state machine to idle and raises an interrupt if the device stays in a state that isn’t

idle for the configured limit. The counter is reset on every state transition.

Set limit while enable is low and then set the enable.

12.8. System timers

12.8.1. Overview

The system timer peripheral on RP2350 provides a microsecond timebase for the system, and generates interrupts

based on this timebase. RP2350 has two instances of the system timer: TIMER0 and TIMER1. This allows for two

separately controlled timers, each in a different security domain. It supports the following features:

• A single 64-bit counter, incrementing once per microsecond

◦Read from a pair of latching registers for race-free reads over a 32-bit bus
• Four alarms that match on the lower 32 bits of the counter and generate IRQ on match

The timer uses a one microsecond reference generated by the tick generators (see Section 8.5), and derived from the

reference clock (Figure 33), which itself is usually connected directly to the crystal oscillator (Section 8.2).

The 64-bit counter effectively cannot overflow (thousands of years at 1 MHz), so the system timer is completely

monotonic in practice.

12.8.1.1. Changes from RP2040

• RP2350 now has two timer instances: TIMER0 and TIMER1
• On RP2350, the tick source for each timer comes from the system-level tick generators (see Section 8.5)
• RP2350 added two new registers: LOCKED is used to disable write access to the timer, and SOURCE allows the timer to
