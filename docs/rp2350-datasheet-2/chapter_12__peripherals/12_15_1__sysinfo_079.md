| 11:0 | BASE: Physical address base for this virtual address range, in units of 4 kiB
(one flash sector).
Taking a 24-bit virtual address, firstly bits 23:22 (the two MSBs) are masked to
zero, and then BASE is added to bits 23:12 (the upper 12 bits) to form the
physical address. Translation wraps on a 16 MiB boundary. | RW | 0x800 |

Offsets: 0x40, 0x50

Description

Configure address translation for XIP virtual addresses 0xc00000 through 0xffffff (a 4 MiB window starting at +12

MiB).

Address translation allows a program image to be executed in place at multiple physical flash addresses (for example,

a double-buffered flash image for over-the-air updates), without the overhead of position-independent code.

At reset, the address translation registers are initialised to an identity mapping, so that they can be ignored if address

translation is not required.

Note that the XIP cache is fully virtually addressed, so a cache flush is required after changing the address translation.

| 26:16 | SIZE: Translation aperture size for this virtual address range, in units of 4 kiB
(one flash sector).
Bits 21:12 of the virtual address are compared to SIZE. Offsets greater than
SIZE return a bus error, and do not cause a QSPI access. | RW | 0x400 |

12.15. System Control Registers

These registers are not associated with any particular peripheral. They control, or provide information about, system-

level hardware such as the bus fabric. This is also where chip identification information such as the JEDEC IDCODE is

provided in a software-accessible manner.

12.15.1. SYSINFO

12.15.1.1. Overview

The sysinfo block contains system information. The first register contains the Chip ID, which allows the programmer to

know which version of the chip software is running on. The second register indicates which package configuration is

used (QFN-60 or QFN-80). The third register will always read as 1.

12.15.1.2. List of registers

The sysinfo registers start at a base address of 0x40000000 (defined as SYSINFO_BASE in SDK).

| Offset | Name | Info |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x00 | CHIP_ID | JEDEC JEP-106 compliant chip identifier. |
| 0x04 | PACKAGE_SEL | Package selection indicator, 0 = QFN80, 1 = QFN60 |
| 0x08 | PLATFORM | Platform register. Allows software to know what environment it
is running in during pre-production development. Post-
production, the PLATFORM is always ASIC, non-SIM. |
| 0x14 | GITREF_RP2350 | Git hash of the chip source. Used to identify chip version. |
