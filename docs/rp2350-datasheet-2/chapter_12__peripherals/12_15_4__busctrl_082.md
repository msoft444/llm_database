12.15.4. BUSCTRL

This block provides basic controls and monitoring for the system bus fabric.

12.15.4.1. Bus priority

RP2350 implements a dynamic bus priority scheme described in Section 2.1.1. The BUS_PRIORITY register implements

the priority controls for this scheme.

12.15.4.2. Performance counters

There are four 24-bit counters, each of which can subscribe to a single performance event from the system bus fabric.

Counters saturate at a value of all-ones: the counter stops incrementing when it reaches its maximum value, rather than

wrapping to zero.

The performance counters are initially disabled: you must write 1 to PERFCTR_EN before the counters begin to

increment. Write any value to a counter to clear the counter to zero in before running a profiled section of code, and

enable the counters immediately before entering the profiled section. Disable the counters again immediately upon

leaving the profiled section. The counters do not support arbitrary writes: they only count up from zero.

Write to a performance event selector register PERFSEL0 through PERFSEL3 to select the performance event which

increments the corresponding counter, PERFCTR0 through PERFCTR3.

For each of the seventeen downstream bus ports on the main system AHB5 crossbar shown in Figure 5, there are four

types of event which the performance counters detect. These events do not distinguish reads from writes, but they do

distinguish different types of bus stall, which can be helpful when diagnosing performance issues. The types of event

are:

Access

Increment when any access completes on this downstream port.

Contested access

Increment when any access completes on this downstream port which previously stalled due to the port being

12.15. System Control Registers
1255

occupied by another access. For example, if two managers access an initially idle port simultaneously, one will

complete before the other. The access that completes first is said to not be contested, and does not increment this

counter. The access that completes second (which was initially deferred due to the access from the other

manager) is contested, and increments this counter when it completes.

Upstream-stalled cycle

Increment once per cycle while any manager experiences a stall on this port. This may be either due to arbitration

with another manager (a contested access) or due to a stall on the downstream bus port, such as access to a slow

peripheral. This is measured at the port, before leaving the main AHB5 crossbar.

Downstream-stalled cycle

Increment once per cycle while this port itself experiences a stall on the downstream bus. This indicates the

peripheral or memory device itself being slow to respond, such as an XIP cache miss.

The first two event types listed above are the same as RP2040. The latter two are new for RP2350.

12.15.4.3. List of registers

The Bus Fabric registers start at a base address of 0x40068000 (defined as BUSCTRL_BASE in SDK).

| 6:0 | Select an event for PERFCTR3. For each downstream port of the main
crossbar, four events are available: ACCESS, an access took place;
ACCESS_CONTESTED, an access took place that previously stalled due to
contention from other masters; STALL_DOWNSTREAM, count cycles where
any master stalled due to a stall on the downstream bus; STALL_UPSTREAM,
count cycles where any master stalled for any reason, including contention
from other masters. | RW | 0x1f |
