WATCHDOG: REASON Register

Offset: 0x08

Description

Logs the reason for the last reset. Both bits are zero for the case of a hardware reset.

Additionally, as of RP2350, a debugger warm reset of either core (SYSRESETREQ or hartreset) will also clear the

watchdog reason register, so that software loaded under the debugger following a watchdog timeout will not continue

to see the timeout condition.

12.10. Always-on timer

12.10.1. Overview

The always-on timer (AON Timer) is the only timer that operates in all power modes. It can be used as a real-time

counter or an interval timer and incorporates an alarm which can be used to trigger a power-up event or an interrupt. It

incorporates a 64-bit counter intended to count 1ms ticks, but the tick generator can be configured to run faster or

slower if required. Note that the AON Timer tick generator is independent of all other tick generators on the chip.

The default tick source is the 32kHz on-chip low-power oscillator (LPOSC), see Section 8.4. The LPOSC frequency is not

precise and may vary with voltage and temperature. When the chip core is powered, the tick source can be switched to

the on-chip crystal oscillator (XOSC) for greater precision. If greater precision is also required when the chip core is
