# 2.1.5. Narrow IO register writes

RP2350 Datasheet

2.1.5. Narrow IO register writes

The majority of memory-mapped IO registers on RP2350 ignore the width of bus read/write accesses. They treat all

writes as though they were 32 bits in size. This means software cannot use byte or halfword writes to modify part of an

IO register: any write to an address where the 30 address MSBs match the register address affects the contents of the

entire register.

To update part of an IO register without a read-modify-write sequence, the best solution on RP2350 is atomic

set/clear/XOR (see Section 2.1.3). This is more flexible than byte or halfword writes, as any combination of fields can be

updated in one operation.

Upon a 8-bit or 16-bit write (such as a strb instruction on the Cortex-M33), the narrow value is replicated multiple times

across the 32-bit data bus, so that it is broadcast to all 8-bit or 16-bit segments of the destination register:

20     stdio_init_all();

21 

22     // We'll use WATCHDOG_SCRATCH0 as a convenient 32 bit read/write register

23     // that we can assign arbitrary values to

24     io_rw_32 *scratch32 = &watchdog_hw->scratch[0];

25     // Alias the scratch register as two halfwords at offsets +0x0 and +0x2

26     volatile uint16_t *scratch16 = (volatile uint16_t *) scratch32;

27     // Alias the scratch register as four bytes at offsets +0x0, +0x1, +0x2, +0x3:

28     volatile uint8_t *scratch8 = (volatile uint8_t *) scratch32;

29 

30     // Show that we can read/write the scratch register as normal:

31     printf("Writing 32 bit value\n");

32     *scratch32 = 0xdeadbeef;

33     printf("Should be 0xdeadbeef: 0x%08x\n", *scratch32);

34 

35     // We can do narrow reads just fine -- IO registers treat this as a 32 bit

36     // read, and the processor/DMA will pick out the correct byte lanes based

37     // on transfer size and address LSBs

38     printf("\nReading back 1 byte at a time\n");

39     // Little-endian!

40     printf("Should be ef be ad de: %02x ", scratch8[0]);

41     printf("%02x ", scratch8[1]);

42     printf("%02x ", scratch8[2]);

43     printf("%02x\n", scratch8[3]);

44 

45     // Byte writes are replicated four times across the 32-bit bus, and IO

46     // registers usually sample the entire write bus.

47     printf("\nWriting 8 bit value 0xa5 at offset 0\n");

48     scratch8[0] = 0xa5;

49     // Read back the whole scratch register in one go

50     printf("Should be 0xa5a5a5a5: 0x%08x\n", *scratch32);

51 

52     // The IO register ignores the address LSBs [1:0] as well as the transfer

53     // size, so it doesn't matter what byte offset we use

54     printf("\nWriting 8 bit value at offset 1\n");

55     scratch8[1] = 0x3c;

56     printf("Should be 0x3c3c3c3c: 0x%08x\n", *scratch32);

57 

58     // Halfword writes are also replicated across the write data bus

59     printf("\nWriting 16 bit value at offset 0\n");

60     scratch16[0] = 0xf00d;

61     printf("Should be 0xf00df00d: 0x%08x\n", *scratch32);

To disable this behaviour on RP2350, set bit 14 of the address by accessing the peripheral at an offset of +0x4000. This
