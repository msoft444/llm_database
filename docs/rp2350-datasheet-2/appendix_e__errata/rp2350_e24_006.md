RP2350-E22

| Reference | RP2350-E22 |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | Parsing a malformed "lollipop" block loop will cause a hang rather than a failure |
| Affects | RP2350 A2 |
| Description | PARTITION TABLEs and IMAGE DEFs metadata are stored as part of a block loop. These block loops are parsed
_ _
during boot and at other times. A "lollipop" block loop is an invalid block loop, which loops back from the
last block to a block, which isn’t the first. Such an invalid block loop is never generated by the SDK or by
picotool; however, it could potentially be generated by other tooling. |
| Workaround | Don’t use "lollipop" block loops. If you program a "lollipop" block loop into flash such that it’s read during
the boot process, it will cause a boot hang and also a hang on entry into BOOTSEL mode. Therefore, to re-
enable booting, you must clear the flash in some other way, for example, from the debugger over SWD. |

RP2350-E23

| Reference | RP2350-E23 |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | PICOBOOT GET_INFO command always returns zero for PACKAGE_SEL |
| Affects | RP2350 A2 |
| Description | The PICOBOOT GET_INFO command can be used to get system information in a similar way to the
bootrom get_sys_info() function. This information can include the value read from PACKAGE_SEL, which
indicates whether the RP2350 package is QFN60 or QFN80.
The SYSINFO block is erroneously left in reset when entering BOOTSEL mode, and thus this register is read
as zero when accessed via PICOBOOT.
This problem doesn’t affect use of the bootrom get_sys_info() function itself from user code. |
| Workaround | Determine the package size by reading register_link_macro:[register=OTP_DATA_NUM_GPIOS_ROW] via
the PICOBOOT OTP_READ command instead. This workaround is used by picotool. |

RP2350-E24

| Reference | RP2350-E24 |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | An attacker with physical access to the chip, moderate hardware, and the ability to physically "glitch" the
CPU at precise times, could cause unsigned code execution on a secured RP2350. |
| Affects | RP2350 A2, RP2350 A3 |
