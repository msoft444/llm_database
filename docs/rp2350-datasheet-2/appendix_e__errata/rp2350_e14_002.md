# RP2350-E14

RP2350 Datasheet

| Workaround | Add a single block at the start of the UF2 with an Absolute family ID, targeting the end of Flash, with block
number set to 0 and number of blocks set to 2. This block is written to flash first but doesn’t reboot the
device, and sets up the flash for the rest of the UF2 to be downloaded correctly.
This is handled for you automatically by picotool in the SDK, which adds this block when generating UF2s
if the --abs-block flag is specified.
This workaround means that the last block of flash is erased when downloading such a UF2, which could
overwrite user data.
As of picotool version 2.1.0, this additional UF2 block is marked with a Raspberry Pi specific UF2
extension UF2 EXTENSION RP2 IGNORE BLOCK (0x9957e304). The RP2350 A3 and later bootroms, contain a fix for
_ _ _ _
this erratum, and therefore don’t need the workaround. The presence of this extension in the UF2 block
allows the newer RP2350 to recognize and ignore the workaround block, thus avoiding the risk of
overwriting user data. |

RP2350-E13

| Reference | RP2350-E13 |

| Summary | A binary containing an explicitly invalid IMAGE DEF followed by a valid IMAGE DEF (in that order) fails to boot
_ _ |
| Affects | RP2350 A2 |
| Description | When the block loop of a binary contains an IMAGE DEF that is explicitly invalid before the valid IMAGE DEF for
_ _
RP2350, booting from that binary fails.
An IMAGE DEF is explicitly invalid if either:
_
• It is for RP2040
• It doesn’t have a rollback version, and the BOOT_FLAGS0.ROLLBACK_REQUIRED flag is set in OTP |
| Workaround | Instead of an explicitly invalid IMAGE DEF, use an IGNORED item. RP2040 doesn’t require an IMAGE DEF to boot a
_ _
binary, and when using rollback, the invalid IMAGE DEF is ignored anyway.
_
SDK uses this workaround for RP2040 binaries. When you set PICO CRT0 INCLUDE PICOBIN BLOCK, the SDK
_ _ _ _
uses an IGNORED item instead of an IMAGE DEF for RP2040 binaries. You can override this behaviour and use
_
an IMAGE DEF by setting PICO CRT0 INCLUDE PICOBIN IMAGE TYPE ITEM. For an additional example, see the
_ _ _ _ _ _ _
universal binaries in pico-examples.
picotool uses this workaround for rollback versions. When you use picotool seal to seal a binary and add
a rollback version, it converts the first IMAGE DEF without a rollback version to an IGNORED item.
