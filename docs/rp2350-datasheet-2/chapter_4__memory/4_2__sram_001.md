# 4.2. SRAM

RP2350 Datasheet

Chapter 4. Memory

RP2350 has embedded ROM, OTP and SRAM. RP2350 provides access to external flash via a QSPI interface.

4.1. ROM

A 32 kB read-only memory (ROM) appears at address 0x00000000. The ROM contents are fixed permanently at the time

the silicon is manufactured. Chapter 5 describes the ROM contents in detail, but in summary it contains:

• Core 0 Boot code (Section 5.2)
• Core 1 Launch code (Section 5.3)
• Runtime APIs (Section 5.4).
• USB bootloader

◦Mass storage interface for drag and drop of UF2 flash and SRAM binaries (Section 5.5)

◦PICOBOOT interface to support picotool and advanced operations like OTP programming (Section 5.6)

◦Support for white-labelling all USB exposed information/identifiers (Section 5.7)
• UART bootloader: minimal shell to load an SRAM binary from a host microcontroller (Section 5.8)

The ROM offers single-cycle access, and has a dedicated AHB5 arbiter, so it can be accessed simultaneously with other

memory devices. Writing to the ROM has no effect, and no bus fault is generated on write.

The ROM is covered by IDAU regions enumerated in Section 10.2.2. These aid in partitioning the bootrom between

Secure and Non-secure code: in particular the USB/UART bootloader runs as a Non-secure client application on Arm, to

reduce the attack surface of the secure boot implementation.

Certain ROM features are not implemented on RISC-V, most notably secure boot.

4.2. SRAM

There is a total of 520 kB (520 × 1024 bytes) of on-chip SRAM. For performance reasons, this memory is physically

partitioned into ten banks, but logically it still behaves as a single, flat 520 kB memory. RP2350 does not restrict the

data stored in each bank: you can use any bank to store processor code, data buffers, or a mixture of the two. There are

eight 16,384 × 32-bit banks (64 kB each) and two 1024 × 32-bit banks (4 kB each).

NOTE

Banking is a physical partitioning of SRAM which improves performance by allowing multiple simultaneous

accesses. Logically, there is a single 520 kB contiguous memory.

Each SRAM bank is accessed via a dedicated AHB5 arbiter. This means different bus managers can access different

SRAM banks in parallel, so up to six 32-bit SRAM accesses can take place every system clock cycle (one per manager).

SRAM is mapped to system addresses starting at 0x20000000. The first 256 kB address region, up to and including

0x2003ffff, is word-striped across the first four 64 kB banks. The next 256 kB address region, up to 0x2007ffff is word-

striped across the remaining four 64 kB banks. The watermark between these two striped regions, at 0x20040000, marks

the boundary between the SRAM0 and SRAM1 power domains.

Consecutive words in the system address space are routed to different RAM banks as shown in Table 434. This scheme

is referred to as sequential interleaving, and improves bus parallelism for typical memory access patterns.
