8.1.4. Frequency counter

The frequency counter measures the frequency of internal and external clocks by counting the clock edges seen over a

test interval. The interval is defined by counting cycles of clk_ref, which must be driven either from XOSC or a stable

external source of known frequency.

The user can pick between accuracy and test time using the FC0_INTERVAL register. Table 542, “Frequency Counter

Test Interval vs Accuracy” shows this trade off:

| Interval Register | Test Interval | Accuracy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1μs | 2048kHz |
| 1 | 2μs | 1024kHz |
| 2 | 4μs | 512kHz |
| 3 | 8μs | 256kHz |
| 4 | 16μs | 128kHz |
| 5 | 32μs | 64kHz |
| 6 | 64μs | 32kHz |
| 7 | 125μs | 16kHz |
| 8 | 250μs | 8kHz |
| 9 | 500μs | 4kHz |
| 10 | 1ms | 2kHz |
| 11 | 2ms | 1kHz |
| 12 | 4ms | 500Hz |
| 13 | 8ms | 250Hz |
| 14 | 16ms | 125Hz |
| 15 | 32ms | 62.5Hz |

8.1.5. Resus

It is possible to write software that inadvertently stops clk_sys. This normally causes an unrecoverable lock-up of the

cores and the on-chip debugger, leaving the user unable to trace the problem. To mitigate against unrecoverable core

lock-up, an automatic resuscitation circuit is provided; this switches clk_sys to a known good clock source (clk_ref) if it

detects no edges over a user-defined interval. clk_ref can be driven from the XOSC, ROSC or an external source. The

interval is programmable via CLK_SYS_RESUS_CTRL.

WARNING

There is no way for resus to revive the chip if clk_ref is also stopped.

To enable the resus:

• Set the timeout interval.
• Set the ENABLE bit in CLK_SYS_RESUS_CTRL.

To detect a resus event:

• Enable the CLK_SYS_RESUS interrupt by setting the interrupt enable bit in INTE.
