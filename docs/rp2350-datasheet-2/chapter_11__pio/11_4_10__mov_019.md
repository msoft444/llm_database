# 11.4.10. MOV

RP2350 Datasheet

11.4.9.2. Operation

Read the selected RX FIFO entry into the OSR. The PIO state machine can read the FIFO entries in any order, indexed

either by the Y register, or an immediate Index in the instruction. Requires the SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_GET configuration field

to be set, otherwise its operation is undefined.

If IdxI (index by immediate) is set, the RX FIFO’s registers are indexed by the two least-significant bits of the Index

operand. Otherwise, they are indexed by the two least-significant bits of the Y register. When IdxI is clear, all non-zero

values of Index are reserved encodings, and their operation is undefined.

When only SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_GET is set, the system can also write the RX FIFO registers with random access via

RXF0_PUTGET0 through RXF0_PUTGET3 (where RXFx indicates which state machine’s FIFO is being accessed). In this

state, the RX FIFO register storage is repurposed as additional configuration registers, which the system can update at

any time and the state machine can read at any time. For example, a UART TX program might use these registers to

configure the number of data bits, or the presence of an additional stop bit.

When both SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_PUT and SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_GET are set, the system can no longer access the RX FIFO

storage registers, but the state machine can now put/get the registers in arbitrary order, allowing them to be used as

additional scratch storage.

NOTE

The RX FIFO storage registers have only a single read port and write port, and access through each port is assigned

to only one of (system, state machine) at any time.

11.4.9.3. Assembler syntax

mov osr, rxfifo[y]

mov osr, rxfifo[<index>]

where:

| y | The literal token "y", indicating the RX FIFO entry is indexed by the Y register. |
| --- | --- |
| <index> | A value (see Section 11.3.2) specifying the RX FIFO entry to read (valid range 0-3). |

MOV PC causes an unconditional jump. MOV EXEC has the same behaviour as OUT EXEC (Section 11.4.5), and allows register

contents to be executed as an instruction. The MOV itself executes in 1 cycle, and the instruction in Source on the next

cycle. Delay cycles on MOV EXEC are ignored, but the executee may insert delay cycles as normal.

The STATUS source has a value of all-ones or all-zeroes, depending on some state machine status such as FIFO

full/empty, configured by EXECCTRL_STATUS_SEL.

MOV can manipulate the transferred data in limited ways, specified by the Operation argument. Invert sets each bit in

Destination to the logical NOT of the corresponding bit in Source, i.e. 1 bits become 0 bits, and vice versa. Bit reverse sets

each bit n in Destination to bit 31 - n in Source, assuming the bits are numbered 0 to 31.

MOV dst, PINS reads pins using the IN pin mapping, masked to the number of bits specified by SHIFTCTRL_IN_COUNT. The LSB

of the read value is the pin indicated by PINCTRL_IN_BASE, and each successive bit comes from a higher-numbered pin,

wrapping after 31. Result bits greater than the width specified by SHIFTCTRL_IN_COUNT configuration are 0.

MOV PINDIRS, src is not supported on PIO version 0.
