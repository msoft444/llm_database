11.4.11.3. Assembler syntax

irq (prev | next) <irq_num> (rel)

irq (prev | next) set <irq_num> (rel)

irq (prev | next) nowait <irq_num> (rel)

irq (prev | next) wait <irq_num> (rel)

irq (prev | next) clear <irq_num> (rel)

where:

| <irq num> (rel)
_ | A value (see Section 11.3.2) specifying the IRQ number to target (0-7). If rel is present, then the
actual IRQ number used is calculated by replacing the low two bits of the IRQ number (irq num )
_ 10
with the low two bits of the sum (irq num + sm num ) where sm num is the state machine number.
_ 10 _ 10 _ 10 |
| --- | --- |
| irq | Set the IRQ without waiting. |
| irq set | Set the IRQ without waiting. |
| irq nowait | Set the IRQ without waiting. |
| irq wait | Set the IRQ and wait for it to be cleared before proceeding. |
| irq clear | Clear the IRQ. |
| prev | To target the IRQ on the next lower numbered PIO block instead of the current PIO block |
| next | To target the IRQ on the next higher numbered PIO block instead of the current PIO block |
