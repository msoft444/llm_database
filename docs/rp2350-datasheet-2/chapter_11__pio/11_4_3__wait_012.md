# 11.4.3. WAIT

![Page 892 figure](images/fig_p0892.png)

RP2350 Datasheet

| <cond> | An optional condition listed above (e.g. !x for scratch X zero). If a condition code is not specified, the
branch is always taken. |
| --- | --- |
| <target> | A program label or value (see Section 11.3.2) representing instruction offset within the program (the
first instruction being offset 0). Because the PIO JMP instruction uses absolute addresses in the PIO
instruction memory, JMPs need to be adjusted based on the program load offset at runtime. This is
handled for you when loading a program with the SDK, but care should be taken when encoding JMP
instructions for use by OUT EXEC. |

11.4.3.2. Operation

Stall until some condition is met.

Like all stalling instructions (Section 11.2.5), delay cycles begin after the instruction completes. That is, if any delay

cycles are present, they do not begin counting until after the wait condition is met.

• Polarity:

◦1: wait for a 1.

◦0: wait for a 0.
• Source: what to wait on. Values are:

◦00: GPIO: System GPIO input selected by Index. This is an absolute GPIO index, and is not affected by the state

machine’s input IO mapping.

◦01: PIN: Input pin selected by Index. This state machine’s input IO mapping is applied first, and then Index

selects which of the mapped bits to wait on. In other words, the pin is selected by adding Index to the

PINCTRL_IN_BASE configuration, modulo 32.

◦10: IRQ: PIO IRQ flag selected by Index

◦11: JMPPIN: wait on the pin indexed by the PINCTRL_JMP_PIN configuration, plus an Index in the range 0-3, all

modulo 32. Other values of Index are reserved.
• Index: which pin or bit to check.

WAIT x IRQ behaves slightly differently from other WAIT sources:

• If Polarity is 1, the selected IRQ flag is cleared by the state machine upon the wait condition being met.
• The flag index is decoded in the same way as the IRQ index field, decoding down from the two MSBs (aligning with

the IRQ instruction IdxMode field):

◦00: the three LSBs are used directly to index the IRQ flags in this PIO block.

◦01 (PREV), the instruction references an IRQ from the next-lower-numbered PIO in the system, wrapping to the

highest-numbered PIO if this is PIO0.

◦10 (REL), the state machine ID (0…3) is added to the IRQ index, by way of modulo-4 addition on the two LSBs.

For example, state machine 2 with a flag value of 0x11 will wait on flag 3, and a flag value of 0x13 will wait on

flag 1. This allows multiple state machines running the same program to synchronise with each other.
