# 3.7.3. Compliance

RP2350 Datasheet

• External interrupts, configurable from 1 to 480 using a contiguous or non-contiguous mapping. This is configured

at implementation.
• Configurable levels of interrupt priority from 8 to 256. This is configured at implementation.
• Dynamic reprioritisation of interrupts.
• Priority grouping. This enables selection of pre-empting interrupt levels and non-pre-empting interrupt levels.
• Support for tail-chaining and late arrival of interrupts. This enables back-to-back interrupt processing without the

overhead of state saving and restoration between interrupts.
• Support for the Armv8-M Security Extension. Secure interrupts can be prioritized above any Non-secure interrupt.

3.7.2.6. Cross Trigger Interface Unit (CTI)

The CTI enables the debug logic, MTB, and ETM to interact with each other and with other CoreSight ™ components.

3.7.2.7. ETM

The ETM provides instruction-only capabilities.

3.7.2.8. MTB

The MTB provides a simple low-cost execution trace solution for the Cortex-M33 processor.

Trace is written to an SRAM interface, and can be extracted using a dedicated AHB slave interface (M-AHB) on the

processor. The MTB can be controlled by memory-mapped registers in the PPB region or by events generated by the

DWT or through the CTI.

See the Arm CoreSight MTB-M33 Technical Reference Manual for more information.

3.7.2.9. Debug and trace

Debug and trace components include a configurable Breakpoint Unit (BPU) used to implement breakpoints and a

configurable Data Watchpoint and Trace (DWT) unit used to implement watchpoints, data tracing, and system profiling.

Other debug and trace components include:

• ITM for support of printf() style debugging, using instrumentation trace
• Interfaces suitable for:

◦Passing on-chip data through a Trace Port Interface Unit (TPIU) to a Trace Port Analyzer (TPA) via a 4-bit DDR

output selected as a GPIO function (see Section 3.5.7)

◦A ROM table to allow debuggers to determine which components are implemented in the Cortex-M33

processor

◦Debugger access to all memory and registers in the system, including access to memory-mapped devices,

access to internal core registers when the core is halted, and access to debug control registers even when

reset is asserted

3.7.3. Compliance

The processor complies with, or implements, the relevant Arm architectural standards and protocols, and relevant

external standards.

RP2350 Datasheet

3.7.3.1. Arm architecture

The processor is compliant with the following:

• Armv8-M Main Extension
• Armv8-M Security Extension
• Armv8-M Protected Memory System Architecture (PMSA)
• Armv8-M Floating-point Extension
• Armv8-M Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Extension
• Armv8-M Debug Extension
• Armv8-M Flash Patch Breakpoint (FPB) architecture version 2.0

3.7.3.2. Bus architecture

The processor provides external interfaces that comply with the AMBA 5 AHB5 protocol. The processor also

implements interfaces for CoreSight and other debug components using the APB4 protocol and ATBv1.1 part of the

AMBA 4 ATB protocol.

For more information, see the:

• Arm AMBA 5 AHB Protocol Specification
• AMBA APB Protocol Version 2.0 Specification
• Arm AMBA 4 ATB Protocol Specification ATBv1.0 and ATBv1.1

The processor also provides a Q-Channel interface. For more information, see the AMBA Low Power Interface

Specification.

3.7.3.3. Debug

The debug features of the processor implement the Arm Debug Interface Architecture. For more information, see the

Arm Debug Interface Architecture Specification, ADIv5.0 to ADIv5.2.

3.7.3.4. Embedded Trace Macrocell

The trace features of the processor implement the Arm Embedded Trace Macrocell (ETM) v4.2 architecture.

For more information, see the Arm CoreSight ETM-M33 Technical Reference Manual.

3.7.3.5. Floating-point unit

The Cortex-M33 processor with FPU supports single-precision arithmetic as defined by the FPv5 architecture that is part

of the Armv8-M architecture. The FPU provides floating-point computation functionality compliant with ANSI/IEEE

Standard 754-2008, IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic.

The FPU supports single-precision add, subtract, multiply, divide, multiply and accumulate, and square root operations.

It also provides conversions between fixed-point and floating-point data formats, and floating-point constant

instructions.

The FPU provides an extension register file containing 32 single-precision registers.

The registers can be viewed as:

3.7. Cortex-M33 processor

RP2350 Datasheet

• Thirty-two 32-bit single-word registers, S0-S31
• Sixteen 64-bit double-word registers, D0-D15
• A combination of registers from these views

3.7.3.5.1. FPU modes

The FPU provides full-compliance, flush-to-zero, and Default NaN modes of operation. In full-compliance mode, the FPU

processes all operations according to the IEEE 754 standard in hardware.

Modes of operation are controlled using the Floating-Point Status and Control Register, FPSCR.

Setting the FPSCR.FZ bit enables Flush-to-Zero (FZ) mode. In FZ mode, the FPU treats all subnormal input operands of

arithmetic operations as zeros. Exceptions that result from a zero operand are signalled appropriately. VABS, VNEG, and

VMOV are not considered arithmetic operations and are not affected by FZ mode. When an operation yields a tiny result

(as described in the IEEE 754 standard, where the destination precision is smaller in magnitude than the minimum

normal value before rounding) FZ mode replaces the result with a zero.

The FPSCR.IDC bit indicates when an input flush occurs.

The FPSCR.UFC bit indicates when a result flush occurs.

Setting the FPSCR.DN bit enables Default NaN (DN) mode. In NaN mode, the result of any arithmetic data processing

operation that involves an input NaN, or that generates a NaN result, returns the default NaN. All arithmetic operations

except for VABS, VNEG, and VMOV ignore the fraction bits of an input NaN.

Setting neither the FPSCR.DN bit nor the FPSCR.FZ bit enables full-compliance mode. In full-compliance mode, FPv5

functionality is compliant with the IEEE 754 standard in hardware.

For more information about the FPU and FPSCR, see the Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual.

3.7.3.5.2. FPU exceptions

The FPU sets the cumulative exception status flag in the FPSCR register as required for each instruction, in accordance

with the FPv5 architecture. The FPU does not support exception traps.

The processor has six output pins. By default, they are disconnected. Each reflect the status of one of the cumulative

exception flags:

FPIXC

Masked floating-point inexact exception.

FPUFC

Masked floating-point underflow exception.

FPOFC

Masked floating-point overflow exception.

FPDZC

Masked floating-point divide by zero exception.

FPIDC

Masked floating-point input denormal exception.

FPIOC

Invalid operation.

When a floating-point context is active, the stack frame extends to accommodate the floating-point registers. To reduce

the additional interrupt latency associated with writing the larger stack frame on exception entry, the processor

supports lazy stacking. This means that the processor reserves space on the stack for the FP state, but does not save

that state information to the stack unless the processor executes an FPU instruction inside the exception handler.
