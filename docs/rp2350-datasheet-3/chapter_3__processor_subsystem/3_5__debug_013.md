# 3.5. Debug

RP2350 Datasheet

• The Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual describes detailed architecture rules for exception handling
• Section 3.8.4 describes standard RISC-V trap handling
• Section 3.8.4.2 describes the standard RISC-V external, timer and software interrupt requests, and how they are

connected on RP2350
• Section 3.8.6.1 describes the Xh3irq interrupt controller, which provides priority-controlled interrupt support for the

system-level interrupts on Hazard3
• Each peripheral has its own interrupt registers which control the assertion of its system-level interrupts listed in

Table 95 — see peripheral documentation for more information

3.3. Event signals (Arm)

Using the WFE instruction, the Cortex-M33 can enter a sleep state until an "event" (or interrupt) takes place. It can also

generate events using the SEV instruction. RP2350 cross-wires event signals between the two processors: an event sent

by one processor will be received on the other.

NOTE

The event flag is "sticky": if both processors send an event (SEV) simultaneously, then enter the sleep state (WFE), they

will both wake immediately. This prevents the processors from getting stuck in a sleep state in this scenario.

Processors also receive an event signal from the global monitor if their reservation is lost due to a write by a different

master, in accordance with Armv8-M architecture requirements.

While in a WFE (or WFI) sleep state, the processor shuts off its internal clock gates to reduce power consumption. When

both processors are in a sleep state and the DMA is inactive, all of RP2350 can enter a sleep state, disabling clocks on

unused infrastructure such as the bus fabric. The rest of RP2350 wakes automatically when either of the processors

wakes. See Section 6.5.2.

3.4. Event signals (RISC-V)

The Hazard3 h3.block instruction halts processor execution until an unblock signal is received. The h3.unblock instruction

sends an unblock signal to other processors. These NOP-compatible hint instructions are documented in Section

3.8.6.3.

On RP2350 the Hazard3 unblock in/out signals are cross-connected between the two processors, and each processor’s

unblock output is also fed back into its input. The global monitor also posts an unblock signal to each core when that

core loses a reservation due to an access by another core or the system DMA.

The Hazard3 MSLEEP CSR defines how deep a sleep the processor will enter when executing a h3.block instruction. By

default this is a simple pipeline stall, but the processor can also gate its own clock and negotiate the system-level clock

wake/sleep state with the clocks block (Section 6.5.2).

The h3.unblock instruction is "sticky": an h3.block will fall through immediately if any unblock signal has been received

since the last time the processor executed an h3.block instruction.

3.5. Debug
