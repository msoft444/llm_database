# 2.1.6. Global Exclusive Monitor

RP2350 Datasheet

causes invalid byte lanes to be driven to zero, rather than being driven with replicated data. In some situations, such as

DMA of 8-bit values to the PWM peripheral, the default replication behaviour is not desirable.

2.1.6. Global Exclusive Monitor

The Global Exclusive Monitor enables standard Arm and RISC-V atomic instructions to safely access shared variables in

SRAM from both cores. This underpins software libraries for manipulating shared variables, such as stdatomic.h in C11.

For detailed rules governing the monitor’s operation, see the Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual.

Arm describes exclusive monitor interactions in terms of a processing element, PE, which performs a sequence of bus

accesses. For RP2350 purposes, this is one AHB5 manager out of the following three: core 0 load/store, core 1

load/store, and DMA write. The DMA does not itself perform exclusive accesses, but its writes are monitored with

respect to exclusive sequences on either processor. No distinction is made between debugger and non-debugger

accesses from a processor.

The monitor observes all transfers on SRAM initiated by the DMA write and processor load/store ports, and pays

particular attention to two types of transfer:

• AHB5 exclusive reads: Arm ldrex* instructions, RISC-V lr.w instructions, and the read phase of RISC-V AMOs (The

Hazard3 cores on RP2350 implement AMOs as an exclusive read/write pair that retries until the write succeeds).
• AHB5 exclusive writes: Arm strex* instructions, RISC-V sc.w instructions, and the writeback phase of RISC-V AMOs

Based on these observations, the monitor enforces that an atomic read-modify-write sequence (formed of an exclusive

read followed by a successful exclusive write by the same PE) is not interleaved with another PE’s successful write

(exclusive or not) to the same reservation granule. A reservation granule is any 16-byte, naturally aligned area of SRAM.

An exclusive write succeeds when all of the following are true:

• It is preceded by an exclusive read by the same PE
• No other exclusive writes were performed by this PE since that exclusive read
• The exclusive read was to the same reservation granule
• The exclusive read was of the same size (byte/halfword/word)
• The exclusive read was from the same security and privilege state
• No other PEs successfully wrote to the same granule since that exclusive read

If the above conditions are not met, the Global Exclusive Monitor shoots down the exclusive write before SRAM can

commit the write data. The failure is reported to the originating PE, for example by a non-zero return value from an Arm

strex instruction.

This implementation of the Armv8-M Global Exclusive Monitor also meets the requirements for RISC-V lr/sc and amo*

instructions, with the caveat that the RsrvEventual PMA is not supported. (In practice, whilst it is quite easy to come up

with contrived examples of starvation such as the DMA writing to a shared variable on every single cycle, bounded

LR/SC and AMO sequences will generally complete quickly.)

CAUTION

Secure software should avoid shared variables in Non-secure-accessible memory. Such variables are vulnerable to

deliberate starvation from exclusive accesses by repeatedly performing non-exclusive writes.

Exclusive accesses are only supported on SRAM. The system treats exclusive accesses to other memory regions as

normal reads and writes, reporting exclusivity failure to the originating PE, for example by a non-zero return value from

an Arm strex instruction.

2.1.6.1. Implementation-defined monitor behaviour

The Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual leaves several aspects of the Global Exclusive Monitor up to the

implementation. For completeness, the RP2350 implementation defines them as follows:

• The reservation granule size is fixed at 16 bytes
• A single reservation is tracked per PE
• The Arm clrex instruction does not affect global monitor state
• Any exclusive write by a PE clears that PE’s global reservation
• A non-exclusive write by a PE does not clear that PE’s global reservation, no matter the address

Only the following updates a PE’s reservation tag, setting its reservation state to Exclusive:

• An exclusive read on SRAM

Only the following changes a PE’s reservation state from Exclusive to Open:

• A successful exclusive write from another PE to this PE’s reservation
• A non-exclusive write from another PE to this PE’s reservation
• Any exclusive write by this PE
• An exclusive read by this PE, not on SRAM

A reservation granule can span multiple SRAM banks, so multiple operations on the same reservation granule may

complete on the same cycle. This can result in the following problematic situations:

• Multiple exclusive writes to the same reservation granule, reserved on each PE: in this case the lowest-numbered

PE succeeds (in the order DMA < core 0 < core 1), and all others fail.
• A mixture of non-exclusive and exclusive writes to the same reservation granule on the same cycle: in this case,

the exclusive writes fail.
• One PE x can write to a reservation granule on the same cycle that another PE y attempts to reserve the same

reservation granule via exclusive load: in this case, y's reservation is granted (i.e. the write takes place logically

before the load).
• One PE x can write to a reservation granule reserved by another PE y, on the same cycle that PE y makes a new

reservation on a different reservation granule: in this case, again, y's reservation is granted.

These rules can be summarised by a logical ordering of all possible events on a reservation granule that can occur on

the same cycle: first all normal writes in arbitrary order, then all exclusive writes in ascending PE order (DMA, core 0,

core 1), then all loads in arbitrary order.

2.1.6.2. Regions without exclusives support

The Global Exclusive monitor only supports exclusive transactions on certain address ranges. The main system SRAM

supports exclusive transactions throughout its entire range: 0x20000000 through 0x20082000. Within ranges that support

exclusive transactions, the Global Exclusive monitor:

• Tracks exclusive sequences across all participating PEs.
• Drives the exclusive success/failure response correctly based on the observed ordering.
• Shoots down failing exclusive writes so that they have no effect.

Exclusive transactions aren’t supported outside of this range; all exclusive accesses report exclusive failure (both

exclusive reads and exclusive writes), and exclusive writes aren’t suppressed.

Outside of regions with exclusive transaction support, load/store exclusive loops run forever while still affecting SRAM

contents. This applies to both Arm processors performing exclusive reads/writes and RISC-V processors performing

lr.w/sc.w instructions. However, an amo*.w instruction on Hazard3 will result in a Store/AMO Fault, as the hardware
