RP2350 Datasheet

| Summary | System Bus Access stalls indefinitely when core 1 is in clock-gated sleep |
| --- | --- |
| Affects | RP2350 A2, RP2350 A3, RP2350 A4 |
| Description | System Bus Access (SBA) is a RISC-V debug feature that allows the Debug Module direct access to the system bus, independent of the state of harts in the system. RP2350 implements SBA by arbitrating Debug Module bus accesses with the core 1 load/store port. Hazard3 implements custom low-power states controlled by the MSLEEP CSR. When MSLEEP.DEEPSLEEP is set, Hazard3 completely gates its clock, with the exception of the minimal logic required to wake again. Due to a design oversight, this also clock-gates the arbiter between SBA and load/store bus access. (This is addressed in upstream commit c11581e.) Consequently, if you initiate an SBA transfer whilst MSLEEP.DEEPSLEEP is set on core 1, and core 1 is in a WFI-equivalent sleep state, the SBA transfer will make no progress until core 1 wakes from the WFI state. The processor wakes upon an enabled interrupt being asserted, or a debug halt request. |
| Workaround | Either configure your debug translator to not use SBA, or don’t enter clock-gated sleep on core 1. The A2 bootrom mitigates this issue by not setting DEEPSLEEP in the initial core 1 wait-for-launch code. The processors are synthesised with hierarchical clock gating, so the top-level clock gate controlled by the DEEPSLEEP flag brings minimal power savings over a default WFI sleep state. |

RP2350-E6

| Reference | RP2350-E6 |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | PMPCFGx RWX fields are transposed |
| Affects | RP2350 A2, RP2350 A3, RP2350 A4 |
| Description | The Physical Memory Protection unit (PMP) defines read, write and execute permissions (RWX) for configurable ranges of physical memory. The RWX permissions for four regions are packed into each 32- bit PMPCFG register, PMPCFG0 through PMPCFG3. Per the RISC-V privileged ISA specification, the permission fields are ordered X, W, R from MSB to LSB. Hazard3 implements them in the order R, W, X. This means software using the correct bit order will have its read permissions applied as execute, and vice versa. (See upstream commit 7d37029.) |
| Workaround | When configuring PMP with X != R, use the bit order implemented by this version of Hazard3. In the SDK, the hardware/regs/rvcsr.h register header provides bitfield definitions for the as-implemented order when building for RP2350. |
