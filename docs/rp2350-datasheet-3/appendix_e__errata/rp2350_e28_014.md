RP2350-E17

| Reference | RP2350-E17 |

| Summary | Performing a guarded read on a single ECC OTP row causes a fault if the data in the adjacent row isn’t also valid ECC data. |
| Affects | RP2350 A2, RP2350 A3, RP2350 A4 |
| Description | Each "ECC row" in OTP stores 16 bits of user data along with error correction information used to correct and/or detect bit errors. ECC rows are used to store data value, which are written a full 16 bits at a time into OTP. A "guarded" ECC row read is intended to be used by the RP2350 boot path, or other Secure software when it expects to read an ECC row and can’t proceed if the row value is invalid. Reading such an invalid ECC value through a "guarded" read halts the chip until it’s rebooted. If ECC row programming is interrupted, an ECC row might contain a value that fails ECC validation. Because any ECC could potentially contain an invalid, partially written value, the bootrom uses a separate "enable" flag in OTP to indicate whether a particular ECC row is expected to contain a valid value. The user is expected to only set this flag after a particular ECC row is known to have been written correctly. The RP2350 OTP hardware actually reads a pair of rows (starting on the even row) whenever an ECC read is performed but only returns one row value. When performing a guarded ECC read, it actually checks both rows validity, so the guarded read can cause a halt if either row in the pair isn’t a valid ECC value. |
| Workaround | • Never store ECC rows and RAW rows in the same pair of rows (a pair of rows starting on an even row number), since the RAW row is unlikely to always contain a valid ECC value. Note however that zero in a RAW row is a valid ECC value. • Never store two ECC rows in the same pair of rows if they are protected by different "enable" flags. This workaround is fine for user use of OTP, however certain pre-existing ECC row pairs used by the bootrom violate workaround 2: • FLASH_DEVINFO and FLASH_PARTITION_SLOT_SIZE • BOOTSEL_LED_CFG and BOOTSEL_PLL_CFG To be absolutely safe, don’t update and set the "enable" flag for one half of the pair after you have set the "enable" flag for the other half. If you want to set both ECC values safely, set them both, then set both "enable" flags. |
