RP2350 Datasheet

| Workaround | If pad pull-down behaviour is required, clear the pad input enable in GPIO0.IE (for GPIOs 0 through 47) to ensure that the pad pull-down resistor pulls the pad signal low. To read the state of a pad pulled-down GPIO from software, enable the input buffer by setting GPIO0.IE immediately before reading, and then re- disable immediately afterwards. If the pad is already a logic-0, re-enabling the input doesn’t disturb the pull-down state. Alternatively an external pull-down of 8.2 kΩ or less can be used. PIO programs can’t toggle pad controls and therefore external pulls may be required, depending on your application. As normal, if ADC channels are being used on a pin, clear the relevant GPIO input enable as stated in Section 12.4.3. |
