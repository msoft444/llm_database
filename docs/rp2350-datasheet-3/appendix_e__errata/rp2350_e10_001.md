| Reference | RP2350-E3 |

| Summary | In QFN-60 package, GPIO NSMASK controls wrong PADS registers _ |
| Affects | RP2350 A2, QFN-60 package only |
| Description | RP2350 remaps IOs, their control registers and their ADC channels so that both package sizes appear to have consecutively numbered GPIOs, even though for physical design reasons the QFN-60 package bonds out a sparse selection of IO pads. The connection between the GPIO_NSMASK0/GPIO_NSMASK1 registers and the PADS registers doesn’t take this remapping into account. Consequently, in the QFN-60 package only, the GPIO NSMASK0 register bits _ are applied to registers for the wrong pads. Specifically, PADS BANK0 registers 29 through 0 are controlled _ by the concatenation of GPIO NSMASK bits 47 through 44, 39 through 33, 30 through 28, 24 through 17 and _ 15 through 8 (all inclusive ranges). This means that granting Non-secure access to the PADS registers in the QFN-60 package doesn’t allow Non-secure software to control the correct pads. It may also allow Non-secure control of pads that aren’t granted in GPIO NSMASK0. _ The QSPI PADS registers (Bank 1) aren’t affected because these aren’t remapped for different packages. |
| Workaround | Disable Non-secure access to the PADS registers by clearing PADS_BANK0.NSP, NSU. Implement a Secure Gateway (Arm) or ecall handler (RISC-V) to permit Non-Secure/U-mode code to read/write its assigned PADS BANK0 registers. _ |

| Summary | UF2 drag-and-drop doesn’t work with partition tables |
| Affects | RP2350 A2 |
| Description | When dragging and dropping a UF2 onto the USB Mass Storage Device, the bootrom on chip revision A2 doesn’t set up the flash before checking the partition table. This causes the UF2 download to fail if there is a partition table present. |
