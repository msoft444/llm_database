RP2350 Datasheet

<delay_value>
Specifies the number of cycles to delay after the instruction completes. The delay_value is

specified as a value (see Section 11.3.2), and in general is between 0 and 31 inclusive (a 5-bit

value), however the number of bits is reduced when sideset is enabled via the .side_set (see

pioasm_side_set) directive. If the <delay_value> is not present, then the instruction has no delay.

NOTE

pioasm instruction names, keywords and directives are case insensitive; lower case is used in the Assembly Syntax

sections below, as this is the style used in the SDK.

NOTE

Commas appear in some Assembly Syntax sections below, but are entirely optional, e.g. out pins, 3 may be written

out pins 3, and jmp x-- label may be written as jmp x--, label. The Assembly Syntax sections below uses the first

style in each case as this is the style used in the SDK.

11.3.7. Pseudo-instructions

pioasm provides aliases for certain instructions, as a convenience:

nop
Assembles to mov y, y. No side effect, but a useful vehicle for a side-set operation or an extra delay.

Data

All PIO instructions execute in one clock cycle.

The function of the 5-bit Delay/side-set field depends on the state machine’s SIDESET_COUNT configuration:

• Up to 5 LSBs (5 minus SIDESET_COUNT) encode a number of idle cycles inserted between this instruction and the next.
