Appendix A: Register field types

Changes from RP2040

Register field types are unchanged.

Standard types

RW:

• Read/Write
• Read operation returns the register value
• Write operation updates the register value

RO:

• Read-only
• Read operation returns the register value
• Write operations are ignored

WO:

• Write-only
• Read operation returns 0
• Write operation updates the register value

Clear types

SC:

• Self-Clearing
• Writing a 1 to a bit in an SC field will trigger an event, once the event is triggered the bit clears automatically
• Writing a 0 to a bit in an SC field does nothing

WC:

• Write-Clear
• Writing a 1 to a bit in a WC field will write that bit to 0
