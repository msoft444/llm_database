# RP2350-E8

RP2350-E8

| Reference | RP2350-E8 |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | CHAIN TO might not fire for zero-length transfers _ |
| Affects | RP2350 A2, RP2350 A3, RP2350 A4 |
| Description | The CTRL.CHAIN TO field configures a channel to start another channel once it completes its programmed _ sequence of transfers. The CHAIN TO takes place on the cycle where the channel’s last write completes, _ and the chainee becomes active on the next cycle. The hardware implementation assumes that CHAIN TO always happens as a result of a write completion. _ This isn’t the case when a channel is triggered with a transfer count of zero; in this case the channel completes on the cycle immediately after the trigger without performing any bus accesses. A CHAIN TO from a channel started with a transfer count of zero will fire if and only if that channel is the _ last channel to have completed a write transfer. This is true only when the channel in question has previously performed a non-zero-length sequence of transfers, and no other channel has completed a write since. |
| Workaround | Don’t use CHAIN TO in conjunction with zero-length transfers. Avoid zero-length transfers in the middle of _ control block lists, and replace them with dummy transfers if possible. |
