# RP2350-E18

RP2350-E18

| Reference | RP2350-E18 |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | The RP2350 will forever fail to boot if FLASH_PARTITION_SLOT_SIZE contains an invalid ECC bit pattern |
| Affects | RP2350 A2, RP2350 A3 |
| Description | If ECC row programming is interrupted, an ECC row may contain a value that fails ECC validation. Because any ECC could potentially contain an invalid, partially written value, the bootrom uses a separate "enable" flag in OTP to indicate whether a particular ECC row is expected to contain a valid value. The user is expected to only set this flag after a particular ECC row is known to have been written correctly. For FLASH_PARTITION_SLOT_SIZE, the "enable" flag is BOOT_FLAGS0.OVERRIDE_FLASH_PARTITION_SLOT_SIZE. In the case of FLASH_PARTITION_SLOT_SIZE, the bootrom reads the row value and asserts the value is valid before checking the enable flag, and thus the boot process will hang if the BOOT_FLAGS0.OVERRIDE_FLASH_PARTITION_SLOT_SIZE row in OTP contains an invalid ECC value. |
| Workaround | Don’t program FLASH_PARTITION_SLOT_SIZE or at least be aware that doing so may brick your device if the programming operation is interrupted or fails. |
