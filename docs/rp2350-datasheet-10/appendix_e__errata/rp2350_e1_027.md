# RP2350-E1

RP2350-E1

| Reference | RP2350-E1 |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | Interpolator OVERF bits are broken by new right-rotate behaviour |
| Affects | RP2350 A2, RP2350 A3, RP2350 A4 |
| Description | RP2350 replaces the interpolator right-shift with a right-rotate, so that left shifts can be synthesised. This is useful for scaled indexed addressing in tight address-generating loops. The OVERF flag functions by checking for nonzero bits in the post-shift value that have been masked out by the MSB mask configured by the CTRL LANE0 MASK MSB and CTRL LANE1 MASK MSB register fields. This is used to _ _ _ _ _ _ discard samples outside of the [0, 1) wrapping domain of UV coordinates represented by ACCUM0 and ACCUM1, for example in affine-transformed sprite sampling. The issue occurs because the right-rotate causes nonzero LSBs to be rotated up to the MSBs. These nonzero bits spuriously set the OVERF flag. |
| Workaround | Either compute OVERF manually by checking the ACCUM0/ACCUM1 MSBs, or precompute the bounds in advance to avoid per-sample checks. |
