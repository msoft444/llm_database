14.5. Storage conditions

To preserve the shelf and floor life of bare RP2350 devices, follow JEDEC J-STD (020E & 033D).

RP2350 QFN-60 is classified as Moisture Sensitivity Level 1 (MSL1). The MSL of QFN-80 is still being characterised and

details will follow in a future datasheet update.

All RP2350 devices should be stored under 30°C and 85% relative humidity.
