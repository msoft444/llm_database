# 13.5.2. OTP access keys

13.5.2. OTP access keys

Page 61 contains 128-bit keys. Each key has a valid bit: when set, the key becomes completely inaccessible to

software. The keys are always read out into hidden registers by hardware during startup so that hardware can perform

key comparisons without exposing the keys to software.

Pages can require specific keys for some page permissions. To unlock the page, the user writes their key to a write-only

register in the OTP block. The page remains unlocked for as long as the correct key is present in this register. To re-lock

the page, erase the active key by writing zeroes to the key register.

The per-page lock config specifies the following:

• a read key index 1-7, or 0 if there is no read key
• a write key index 1-7 or 0 if there is no write key
• the no-key state: either Read-only or Inaccessible, state of the page when no registered key has been entered by

software into the key register

The no-key state is encoded as follows:

• 0 for Read-only (lock level 1)
• 1 for Inaccessible (lock level 2).

TIP

Key index 7 does not exist in the configuration. If you specify key index 7, it is guaranteed to never match.

The hardware determines the key lock level by comparing the entered key to the key config of the current page, as

follows:

1. If no keys are registered, the key lock level is 0

2. Else if keys are registered and no matching key is entered, the key lock level is 2 or 1 depending on the "no-key

state" config

3. Else if a write key is registered and present, the key lock level is 0

4. Else if a read key is registered and present, the key lock level is 1

Hardware compares the key lock level to the page’s lock level for the current security domain (Secure/Non-secure) and

takes whichever is higher. For example, if a page has been made Non-secure read-only, there is nothing a key can do to

make it Non-secure writable.

There are six 128-bit access keys stored in the OTP. Keys 5 and 6 also function as the Secure debug access key and

Non-secure debug access key, respectively. See Section 3.5.9.2 for information on how the debug keys affect external

debug access.

You might use OTP access keys if a bootloader contains OTP configuration that needs to be Secure-writable only to the

board owner, not to general Secure software on the device.
