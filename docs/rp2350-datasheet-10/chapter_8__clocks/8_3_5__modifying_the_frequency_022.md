8.3.5. Modifying the frequency

The ROSC is arranged as 8 stages, each with programmable drive. The ROSC provides two methods of controlling the

frequency. The frequency range controls the number of stages in the ROSC loop and the FREQA & FREQB registers control

the drive strength of the stages.

To change the frequency range, write to the FREQ_RANGE register, which controls the number of stages in the ROSC loop.

The FREQ_RANGE register supports the following configurations:

| Name | Number of stages | Range (stages) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LOW | 8 | 0-7 |
| MEDIUM | 6 | 2-7 |
| HIGH | 4 | 4-7 |
| TOOHIGH | 2 | 6-7 |

*Table 604. ROSC*

Change FREQ_RANGE one step at a time until you reach the desired range. When increasing the frequency range, ROSC

output will not glitch, so the output clock can continue to be used. When decreasing the frequency range, ROSC output

will glitch, so you must select an alternate clock source for the modules clocked by ROSC or hold them in reset during

the transition.

The behaviour has not been fully characterised, but the MEDIUM range will be approximately 1.33 times the LOW range, the

HIGH range will be 2 times the LOW range and the TOOHIGH range will be 4 times the LOW range. The TOOHIGH range is aptly

named. It should not be used because the internal logic of the ROSC will not run at that frequency.

The FREQA and FREQB registers control the drive strength of the stages in the ROSC loop. As the drive strength increases,

the delay through the stage decreases and the oscillation frequency increases. Each stage has 3 drive strength control

bits. Each bit turns on an additional drive, therefore each stage has 4 drive strength settings equal to the number of bits

set, with 0 being the default, 1 being double drive, 2 being triple drive and 3 being quadruple drive. Extra drives do not

have a linear effect on frequency: the second has less impact than the first, the third has less impact than the second,

and so on. To ensure smooth transitions, change one drive strength bit at a time. When FREQ_RANGE shortens the ROSC

loop, the bypassed stages still propagate the signal and therefore their drive strengths must be set to at least the same

level as the lowest drive strength in the stages that are in the loop. This will not affect the oscillation frequency.
