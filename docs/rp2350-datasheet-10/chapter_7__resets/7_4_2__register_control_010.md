# 7.4.2. Register control

7.4.2. Register control

The PSM is a fully automated piece of hardware: it requires no input from the user to work. The debugger can trigger a

full or partial sequence by writing to the FRCE_OFF register. The FRCE_ON register is a development feature that does

nothing in production devices.
