# 7.1. Overview

7.1. Overview

Resets are divided into three categories, each of which applies to a subset of RP2350:

Chip-level resets

apply to the entire chip. Used to put the entire chip into a default state. These are initiated by hardware events, the

watchdog, or the debugger. When all chip level resets are de-asserted, the system resets are released and the

processors boot.

System resets

apply to components essential to processor operation. System components have interdependencies, therefore their

resets are de-asserted in sequence by the Power-on State Machine (PSM). The full PSM sequence is triggered by

deassertion of chip-level resets. A full or partial sequence can be triggered by the watchdog or debugger. The

sequence culminates in processor boot.

Subsystem resets

apply to components not essential for operation of the processors. The resets can be independently asserted by

writing to the RESETS registers and de-asserted by software, the watchdog, or the debugger.

The watchdog can be programmed to trigger any of the above categories.
