# 10.6.1. GPIO access control

10.6.1. GPIO access control

The GPIO Non-secure access mask registers, GPIO_NSMASK0 and GPIO_NSMASK1, contain one bit per GPIO. The

layout of these two registers matches the layout of the SIO GPIO registers (Section 3.1.3), including the positions of the

QSPI and USB DM/DP bits. Each GPIO is accessible to Non-secure software if and only if the relevant GPIO_NSMASK bit is

set. This prevents Non-secure software from interfering with or observing GPIOs used by Secure software.

All system-level GPIO controls, such as the IO and pad control registers, are shared by Secure and Non-secure code.

However, access to these registers is filtered on a GPIO-by-GPIO basis according to the GPIO_NSMASK registers. This

means that the same code can run unmodified in either a Secure or Non-secure context, and Secure software does not

have to implement any interfaces for Non-secure GPIO access, provided that the appropriate GPIO security mask has

been configured.

Setting a GPIO_NSMASK bit has the following effects on the corresponding GPIO:

• The relevant SIO GPIO register bit (Section 3.1.3) becomes accessible through bus access to the Non-secure SIO.

◦Otherwise the bit is read-only zero.
• The relevant SIO GPIO register bit becomes accessible to Non-secure code using GPIO coprocessor instructions

(Section 3.6.1).

◦Otherwise the bit is read-only zero.

◦Non-secure code may execute GPIO coprocessor instructions if and only if coprocessor 0 is granted to Non-

secure in NSACR, and enabled in the Non-secure PPB instance of the CPACR register.
• The relevant IO control register (Section 9.11.1 or Section 9.11.2) becomes accessible to Non-secure code.

◦Otherwise it is read-only zero.
• GPIO functions for Secure-only peripherals can not be selected on this GPIO

◦Attempting to select such a peripheral will select the null function (0x1f) instead

◦If a Secure-only peripheral is selected at the time that this GPIO is made Non-secure-accessible, then the

selection will be changed to the null function.
• The relevant pad control register (Section 9.11.3 or Section 9.11.4) becomes accessible to Non-secure code.

◦Otherwise it is read-only zero.
• Interrupts for this GPIO are routed to the Non-secure GPIO interrupts, IO_IRQ_BANK0_NS and IO_IRQ_QSPI_NS, rather than

the default Secure interrupts, IO_IRQ_BANK0 and IO_IRQ_QSPI. (See Section 3.2 for the system IRQ listing.)
• The relevant GPIO interrupt control and status bits, e.g. PROC0_INTS0, become accessible to Non-secure code.

◦Otherwise they are read-only zero.
• The GPIO can be read by PIO instances which are Non-secure-accessible.

◦Otherwise it reads as zero.

◦Like the SIO, PIO can observe GPIOs even when not function-selected, so additional logic masks Secure-only

GPIOs from Non-secure-accessible PIO instances

NOTE

Due to RP2350-E3, on RP2350A (QFN-60), access to the PADS_BANK0 registers is controlled by the wrong bits of

GPIO_NSMASK. On QFN-60 you must disable Non-secure access to the pads registers, and implement a software

interface for Non-secure code to manipulate its assigned PADS registers.
