# 5.1.14. Partition-Table-in-Image boot

5.1.14. Partition-Table-in-Image boot

If both a PARTITION_TABLE and an IMAGE_DEF block are found in the valid block loop that starts within the first 4 kB of flash, a

third type of flash boot takes place. The IMAGE_DEF and PARTITION_TABLE must only be recognised, not necessarily valid or

correctly signed. This stipulation prevents a causality loop.

This is known as partition-table-in-image boot, since the application contains the partition table (instead of vice versa).

This partition table is referred to as an embedded partition table.

The PARTITION_TABLE is loaded as the current partition table, and the IMAGE_DEF is launched directly. The table defined by

the PARTITION_TABLE is not searched for IMAGE_DEFs to boot.

The following common cases might use this scenario:

• You are only using the PARTITION_TABLE for flash permissions. You want to load that partition table, then boot as

normal.
• The IMAGE_DEF contains a small bootloader stored alongside the partition table. In this case, the partition table will

once again be loaded, and the associated image entered. The entered image will then likely pick a partition from

the partition table, and launch an image from there itself.
