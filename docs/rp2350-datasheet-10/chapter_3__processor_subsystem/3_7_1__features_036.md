# 3.7.1. Features

3.7.1. Features

The Arm Cortex-M33 processor provides the following features and benefits:

• An in-order issue pipeline
• Thumb-2 technology; for more information, see the Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual
• Little-endian data accesses
• A Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) closely integrated with the processor
• A Floating Point Unit (FPU) supporting single-precision arithmetic
• Support for exception-continuable instructions, such as LDM, LDMDB, STM, STMDB, PUSH, POP, VLDM, VSTM,

VPUSH, and VPOP
• A low-cost debug solution that provides the ability to implement:

◦Breakpoints

◦Watchpoints

◦Tracing

◦System profiling

◦Support for printf() style debugging through an Instrumentation Trace Macrocell (ITM)
• Support for the Embedded Trace Macrocell (ETM) instruction trace option; for more information, see the Arm

CoreSight ETM-M33 Technical Reference Manual
• A coprocessor interface for external hardware accelerators
• Low-power features including architectural clock gating, sleep mode, and a power-aware system with Wake-up

Interrupt Controller (WIC)
• A memory system that includes memory protection and security attribution
