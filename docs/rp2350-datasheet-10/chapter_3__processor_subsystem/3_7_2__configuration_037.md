RP2350 Datasheet

• ITM: DWT and ITM trace
• ETM: ETM trace
• MTB: no MTB trace
• WIC: Wake up interrupt controller
• WICLINES: 55: All external interrupts and 3 internal events: NMI, RVEX, Debug

Architectural clock gating allows the processor core to support SLEEP and DEEPSLEEP power states by disabling the

clock to parts of the processor core. Power gating is not supported.

Each Cortex-M33 core has its own interrupt controller that can individually mask out interrupt sources as required. The

same interrupts route to both Cortex-M33 cores.

The processor supports the following interfaces:

• Code AHB (C-AHB) interface
• System AHB (S-AHB) interface
• External PPB (EPPB) APB interface
• Debug AHB (D-AHB) interface

The processor implements the following optional interfaces:

• Arm TrustZone technology, using the Armv8-M Security Extension supporting Secure and Non-secure states
• Memory Protection Units (MPUs), which you can configure to protect regions of memory
• Floating-point arithmetic functionality with support for single precision arithmetic
• Support for ETM trace

3.7.2.1. Modifications by Raspberry Pi

3.7.2.1.1. UNCROSS_I_D

The original Cortex-M33 processor design routes the following operations to either the Code or System port:

• instruction fetch
• load/stores
• debugger accesses

Accesses below address 0x20000000 route to the Code port. All other accesses route to the System port.

This routing strategy makes contention possible on both the internal bus matrix and the main system AHB5 crossbar.

The Cortex-M33 Technical Reference Manual describes this strategy in detail.

In RP2350, Raspberry Pi modified the Cortex-M33 bus matrix to:

• route all instruction fetch operations to the Code port

3.7. Cortex-M33 processor

RP2350 Datasheet

• route all load/stores and debugger accesses to the System port

This eliminates internal conflicts and improves performance in certain software use cases, e.g. when allocating both

code and data from a single unified SRAM pool.

In Section 3.7.2, we refer to this feature as UNCROSS_I_D.

There are no other modifications to the Cortex-M33 processor.

NOTE

This datasheet may refer to the Cortex-M33 Code and System ports as the instruction and data ports respectively (I

and D), to reflect this modification to the core’s integrated bus matrix.

3.7.2.2. Interfaces

The processor has various external interfaces:

Code and System AHB interfaces

Harvard AHB bus architecture supporting exclusive transactions and security state.

System AHB interface

The System AHB (S-AHB) interface is used for any instruction fetch and data access to the memory-mapped SRAM,

Peripheral, External RAM and External device, or Vendor_SYS regions of the Armv8-M memory map.

Code AHB interface

The Code AHB (C-AHB) interface is used for any instruction fetch and data access to the Code region of the Armv8-

M memory map.

External Private Peripheral Bus

The External PPB (EPPB) APB interface enables access to CoreSight-compatible debug and trace components in a

system connected to the processor.

Secure attribution interface

The processor has an interface that connects to an external Implementation Defined Attribution Unit (IDAU), which

enables your system to set security attributes based on address.

ATB interfaces

The ATB interfaces output trace data for debugging. The ATB interfaces are compatible with the CoreSight

architecture. See the Arm CoreSight Architecture Specification v2.0 for more information. The instruction ATB

interface is used by the ETM, and the instrumentation ATB interface is used by the Instrumentation Trace Macrocell

(ITM).

Micro Trace Buffer interfaces

The Micro Trace Buffer (MTB) AHB slave interface and SRAM interface are for the CoreSight Micro Trace Buffer.

Coprocessor interface

The coprocessor interface is designed for closely coupled external accelerator hardware.

Debug AHB interface

The Debug AHB (D-AHB) slave interface allows a debugger access to registers, memory, and peripherals. The D-

AHB interface provides debug access to the processor and the complete memory map.

Cross Trigger Interface

The processor includes a Cross Trigger Interface (CTI) Unit that has an interface that is suitable for connection to

external CoreSight components using a Cross Trigger Matrix (CTM).

Power control interface

The processor supports a number of internal power domains that can be enabled and disabled using Q-channel

interfaces connected to a Power Management Unit (PMU) in the system.

3.7.2.3. Security attribution and memory protection

The Cortex-M33 processor supports the Armv8-M Protected Memory System Architecture (PMSA) that provides

programmable support for memory protection using a number of software controllable regions. RP2350 supports 8

programmable regions.

PMSA allows privileged software to assign access permissions to a memory region. When unprivileged software

attempts to access the region, a fault exception is triggered. PMSA includes fault status registers that allow an

exception handler to determine the source of the fault, apply corrective action, and notify the system. This reduces the

potential impact of incorrectly-written application code.

The Cortex-M33 processor also includes support for defining memory regions as Secure or Non-secure, as defined in

the Armv8-M Security Extension. This protects memory regions from accesses with an inappropriate level of security.

3.7.2.4. Floating-point unit (FPU)

The FPU provides:

• Instructions for single-precision (C programming language float type) data-processing operations
• Instructions for double-precision (C programming language double type) load and store operations
• Combined multiply-add instructions for increased precision (Fused MAC)
• Hardware support for conversion, addition, subtraction, multiplication, accumulate, division, and square-root
• Hardware support for denormals and all IEEE Standard 754-2008 rounding modes
• Thirty-two 32-bit single-precision registers or sixteen 64-bit double-precision registers
• Lazy floating-point context save

3.7.2.4.1. Lazy floating-point context save

This FPU function delays automated stacking of floating-point state until the ISR attempts to execute a floating-point

instruction. This reduces the latency to enter the ISR and removes floating-point context save for ISRs that do not use

floating-point.

3.7.2.5. NVIC

The Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller NVIC prioritizes external interrupt signals. Software can set the priority of each

interrupt. The NVIC and the Cortex-M33 processor core are closely coupled, providing low latency interrupt processing

and efficient processing of late arriving interrupts.

NOTE

"Nested" refers to the fact that interrupts can themselves be interrupted, by higher-priority interrupts. "Vectored"

refers to the hardware dispatching each interrupt to a distinct handler routine specified by a vector table. For more

details about nesting and vectoring behaviour, see the Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual.

All NVIC registers are only accessible using word transfers. Any attempt to read or write a halfword or byte individually

is unpredictable.

NVIC registers are always little-endian.

The Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) is closely integrated with the core to achieve low-latency interrupt

processing.

Functions of the NVIC include:

RP2350 Datasheet

• External interrupts, configurable from 1 to 480 using a contiguous or non-contiguous mapping. This is configured

at implementation.
• Configurable levels of interrupt priority from 8 to 256. This is configured at implementation.
• Dynamic reprioritisation of interrupts.
• Priority grouping. This enables selection of pre-empting interrupt levels and non-pre-empting interrupt levels.
• Support for tail-chaining and late arrival of interrupts. This enables back-to-back interrupt processing without the

overhead of state saving and restoration between interrupts.
• Support for the Armv8-M Security Extension. Secure interrupts can be prioritized above any Non-secure interrupt.

3.7.2.6. Cross Trigger Interface Unit (CTI)

The CTI enables the debug logic, MTB, and ETM to interact with each other and with other CoreSight ™ components.

3.7.2.7. ETM

The ETM provides instruction-only capabilities.

3.7.2.8. MTB

The MTB provides a simple low-cost execution trace solution for the Cortex-M33 processor.

Trace is written to an SRAM interface, and can be extracted using a dedicated AHB slave interface (M-AHB) on the

processor. The MTB can be controlled by memory-mapped registers in the PPB region or by events generated by the

DWT or through the CTI.

See the Arm CoreSight MTB-M33 Technical Reference Manual for more information.

3.7.2.9. Debug and trace

Debug and trace components include a configurable Breakpoint Unit (BPU) used to implement breakpoints and a

configurable Data Watchpoint and Trace (DWT) unit used to implement watchpoints, data tracing, and system profiling.

Other debug and trace components include:

• ITM for support of printf() style debugging, using instrumentation trace
• Interfaces suitable for:

◦Passing on-chip data through a Trace Port Interface Unit (TPIU) to a Trace Port Analyzer (TPA) via a 4-bit DDR

output selected as a GPIO function (see Section 3.5.7)

◦A ROM table to allow debuggers to determine which components are implemented in the Cortex-M33

processor

◦Debugger access to all memory and registers in the system, including access to memory-mapped devices,

access to internal core registers when the core is halted, and access to debug control registers even when

reset is asserted
