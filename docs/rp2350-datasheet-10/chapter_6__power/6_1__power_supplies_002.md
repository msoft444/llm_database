6.1. Power supplies

RP2350 requires five separate power supplies. However, in most applications, several of these can be combined and

connected to a single power source. Typical applications only require a single 3.3 V supply. See Figure 19.

The power supplies and a number of potential power supply schemes are described in the following sections. Detailed

power supply parameters are provided in Section 14.9.5.
