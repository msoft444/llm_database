# 4.2. SRAM

4.2. SRAM

There is a total of 520 kB (520 × 1024 bytes) of on-chip SRAM. For performance reasons, this memory is physically

partitioned into ten banks, but logically it still behaves as a single, flat 520 kB memory. RP2350 does not restrict the

data stored in each bank: you can use any bank to store processor code, data buffers, or a mixture of the two. There are

eight 16,384 × 32-bit banks (64 kB each) and two 1024 × 32-bit banks (4 kB each).

NOTE

Banking is a physical partitioning of SRAM which improves performance by allowing multiple simultaneous

accesses. Logically, there is a single 520 kB contiguous memory.

Each SRAM bank is accessed via a dedicated AHB5 arbiter. This means different bus managers can access different

SRAM banks in parallel, so up to six 32-bit SRAM accesses can take place every system clock cycle (one per manager).

SRAM is mapped to system addresses starting at 0x20000000. The first 256 kB address region, up to and including

0x2003ffff, is word-striped across the first four 64 kB banks. The next 256 kB address region, up to 0x2007ffff is word-

striped across the remaining four 64 kB banks. The watermark between these two striped regions, at 0x20040000, marks

the boundary between the SRAM0 and SRAM1 power domains.

Consecutive words in the system address space are routed to different RAM banks as shown in Table 434. This scheme

is referred to as sequential interleaving, and improves bus parallelism for typical memory access patterns.

*Table 434. SRAM bank0/1/2/3 striped mapping.*

The top two 4 kB regions (starting at 0x20080000 and 0x20081000) map directly to the smaller 4 kB memory banks.

Software may choose to use these for per-core purposes (e.g. stack and frequently-executed code), guaranteeing that

the processors never stall on these accesses. Like all SRAM on RP2350, these banks have single-cycle access from all

managers, (provided no other managers access the bank in the same cycle) so it is reasonable to treat memory as a

single 520 kB device.

NOTE

RP2040 had a non-striped SRAM mirror. RP2350 no longer has a non-striped mirror, to avoid mapping the same

SRAM location as both Secure and Non-secure. You can still achieve some explicit bandwidth partitioning by

allocating data across two 256 kB blocks of 4-way-striped SRAM.
