# 12.15. System Control Registers

12.15. System Control Registers

These registers are not associated with any particular peripheral. They control, or provide information about, system-

level hardware such as the bus fabric. This is also where chip identification information such as the JEDEC IDCODE is

provided in a software-accessible manner.
