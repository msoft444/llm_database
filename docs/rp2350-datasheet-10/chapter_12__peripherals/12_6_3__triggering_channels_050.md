# 12.6.3. Triggering channels

12.6.3. Triggering channels

After a channel has been correctly configured, you must trigger it. This instructs the channel to begin scheduling bus

accesses, either paced by a peripheral data request signal (DREQ) or as fast as possible. The following events can

trigger a channel:

• A write to a channel trigger register.
• Completion of another channel whose CHAIN_TO points to this channel.
• A write to the MULTI_CHAN_TRIGGER register (can trigger multiple channels at once).

Each trigger mechanism covers different use cases. For example, trigger registers are simple and efficient when

configuring and starting a channel in an interrupt service routine because the channel is triggered by the last

configuration write. CHAIN_TO allows one channel to callback to another channel, which can then reconfigure the first

channel. MULTI_CHAN_TRIGGER allows software to simply start a channel without touching any of its configuration

registers.

When triggered, the channel sets its CTRL.BUSY flag to indicate it is actively scheduling transfers. This remains set until

the transfer count reaches zero, or the channel is aborted via the CHAN_ABORT register (Section 12.6.8.3).

When a channel is already running, indicated by BUSY = 1, it ignores additional triggers. A channel that is disabled (CTRL.EN

is clear) also ignores triggers.

12.6.3.1. Aliases and triggers

| Offset | +0x0 | +0x4 | +0x8 | +0xc (Trigger) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0x00 (Alias 0) | READ ADDR _ | WRITE ADDR _ | TRANS COUNT _ | CTRL TRIG _ |
| 0x10 (Alias 1) | CTRL | READ ADDR _ | WRITE ADDR _ | TRANS COUNT TRIG _ _ |
| 0x20 (Alias 2) | CTRL | TRANS COUNT _ | READ ADDR _ | WRITE ADDR TRIG _ _ |
| 0x30 (Alias 3) | CTRL | WRITE ADDR _ | TRANS COUNT _ | READ ADD TRIG _ _ |

*Table 1145. Control register aliases. Each channel has four control/status registers. Each register can be accessed at multiple different addresses. In each naturally-aligned group of four, all four registers appear, in*

different orders.

The four CSRs are aliased multiple times in memory. Each of the four aliases exposes the same four physical registers,

but in a different order. The final register in each alias (at offset +0xc, highlighted) is a trigger register. Writing to the

trigger register starts the channel.

Often, only alias 0 is used, and aliases 1 through 3 can be ignored. To configure and start the channel, write READ_ADDR,

WRITE_ADDR, TRANS_COUNT, and finally CTRL. Since CTRL is the trigger register in alias 0, this starts the channel.

The other aliases allow more compact control block lists when using one channel to configure another, and more

efficient reconfiguration and launch in interrupt handlers:

• Each CSR is a trigger register in one of the aliases:

◦When gathering fixed-size buffers into a peripheral, the DMA channel can be configured and launched by

writing only READ_ADDR_TRIG.

◦When scattering from a peripheral to fixed-size buffers, the channel can be configured and launched by

writing only WRITE_ADDR_TRIG.
• Useful combinations of registers appear as naturally-aligned tuples which contain a trigger register. In conjunction

with channel chaining and address wrapping, these implement compressed control block formats, e.g.:

◦(WRITE_ADDR, TRANS_COUNT_TRIG) for peripheral scatter operations

◦(TRANS_COUNT, READ_ADDR_TRIG) for peripheral gather operations, or calculating CRCs on a list of buffers

◦(READ_ADDR, WRITE_ADDR_TRIG) for manipulating fixed-size buffers in memory

Trigger registers do not start the channel if:

• The channel is disabled via CTRL.EN (if the trigger is CTRL, the just-written value of EN is used, not the value currently

in the CTRL register)
• The channel is already running
• The value 0 is written to the trigger register (useful for ending control block chains, see null triggers (Section

12.6.3.3))
• The bus access has a security level lower than the channel’s security level (Section 12.6.6.1)

12.6.3.2. Chaining

When a channel completes, it can name a different channel to immediately be triggered. This can be used as a callback

for the second channel to reconfigure and restart the first.

This feature is configured through the CHAIN_TO field in the channel CTRL register. This 4-bit value selects a channel that

will start when this one finishes. A channel cannot chain to itself. Setting CHAIN_TO to a channel’s own index prevents

chaining.

Chain triggers behave the same as triggers from other sources, such as trigger registers. For example, they cause

TRANS_COUNT to reload, and they are ignored if the targeted channel is already running.

One application for CHAIN_TO is for a channel to request reconfiguration by another channel from a sequence of control

blocks in memory. Channel A is configured to perform a wrapped transfer from memory to channel B’s control registers

(including a trigger register), and channel B is configured to chain back to channel A when it completes each transfer

sequence. This is shown explicitly in the DMA control blocks example (Section 12.6.9.2).

Use of the register aliases (Section 12.6.3.1) enables compact formats for DMA control blocks: as little as one word, in

some cases.

Another use of chaining is a ping-pong configuration, where two channels each trigger one another. The processor can

respond to the channel completion interrupts and reconfigure each channel after it completes. However, the chained

channel, which has already been configured, starts immediately. In other words, channel configuration and channel

operation are pipelined. This can improve performance dramatically when a usage pattern requires many short transfer

sequences.

The Section 12.6.9 goes into more detail on the possibilities of chain triggers in the real world.

12.6.3.3. Null triggers and chain interrupts

As mentioned in Section 12.6.3.1, writing all-zeroes to a trigger register does not start the channel. This is called a null

trigger, and it has two purposes:

• Cause a halt at the end of an array of control blocks, by appending an all-zeroes block.
• Reduce the number of interrupts generated when using control blocks.

By default, channels generate an interrupt each time they finish a transfer sequence, unless that channel’s IRQ is

masked in INTE0 through INTE3. The rate of interrupts can be excessive, particularly as processor attention is generally

not required while a sequence of control blocks are in progress. However, processor attention is required at the end of a

chain.

The channel CTRL register has a field called IRQ_QUIET. Its default value is 0. When this set to 1, channels generate an

interrupt when they receive a null trigger, but not on normal completion of a transfer sequence. The interrupt is

generated by the channel that receives the trigger.
