RP2350 Datasheet

2.1.3. Atomic register access

Each peripheral register block is allocated 4 kB of address space, with registers accessed using one of 4 methods,

selected by address decode.

• Addr + 0x0000 : normal read write access
• Addr + 0x1000 : atomic XOR on write
• Addr + 0x2000 : atomic bitmask set on write
• Addr + 0x3000 : atomic bitmask clear on write

This allows software to modify individual fields of a control register without performing a read-modify-write sequence.

Instead, the peripheral itself modifies its contents in-place. Without this capability, it is difficult to safely access IO

registers when an interrupt service routine is concurrent with code running in the foreground, or when the two

processors run code in parallel.

The four atomic access aliases occupy a total of 16 kB. Native atomic writes take the same number of clock cycles as

normal writes. Most peripherals on RP2350 provide this functionality natively, but some peripherals (I2C, UART, SPI and

SSI) add this functionality using a bus interposer. The bus interposer translates upstream atomic writes into

downstream read-modify-write sequences at the boundary of the peripheral, at the cost of additional clock cycles.

Atomic writes that use a bus interposer take two additional clock cycles compared to normal writes.

The following registers do not support atomic register access:

• SIO (Section 3.1), though some individual registers (for example, GPIO) have set, clear, and XOR aliases.
• Any register accessed through the self-hosted CoreSight window, including Arm Mem-APs and the RISC-V Debug

Module.
• Standard Arm control registers on the Cortex-M33 private peripheral bus (PPB), except for Raspberry Pi-specific

registers on the EPPB.
• OTP programming registers accessed through the SBPI bridge.
