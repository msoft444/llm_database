# 11.5.3. FIFO joining

11.5.3. FIFO joining

By default, each state machine possesses a 4-entry FIFO in each direction: one for data transfer from system to state

machine (TX), the other for the reverse direction (RX). However, many applications do not require bidirectional data

transfer between the system and an individual state machine, but may benefit from deeper FIFOs: in particular, high-

bandwidth interfaces such as DPI. For these cases, SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN can merge the two 4-entry FIFOs into a single 8-entry

FIFO.

*Figure 48. Joinable dual FIFO. A pair of four-entry FIFOs, implemented with four data registers, a 1:4 decoder and a 4:1 multiplexer. Additional multiplexing allows write data and read data to cross between the TX and RX lanes, so that all 8 entries are accessible from both ports*

Another example is a UART: because the TX/CTS and RX/RTS parts a of a UART are asynchronous, they are

implemented on two separate state machines. It would be wasteful to leave half of each state machine’s FIFO

resources idle. The ability to join the two halves into just a TX FIFO for the TX/CTS state machine, or just an RX FIFO in

the case of the RX/RTS state machine, allows full utilisation. A UART equipped with an 8-deep FIFO can be left alone for

twice as long between interrupts as one with only a 4-deep FIFO.

When one FIFO is increased in size (from 4 to 8), the other FIFO on that state machine is reduced to zero. For example, if

joining to TX, the RX FIFO is unavailable, and any PUSH instruction will stall. The RX FIFO will appear both RXFULL and

RXEMPTY in the FSTAT register. The converse is true if joining to RX: the TX FIFO is unavailable, and the TXFULL and TXEMPTY

bits for this state machine will both be set in FSTAT. Setting both FJOIN_RX and FJOIN_TX makes both FIFOs unavailable.

8 FIFO entries is sufficient for 1 word per clock through the RP2350 system DMA, provided the DMA is not slowed by

contention with other masters.

Changing FJOIN discards any data present in the state machine’s FIFOs. If this data is irreplaceable, it must be
