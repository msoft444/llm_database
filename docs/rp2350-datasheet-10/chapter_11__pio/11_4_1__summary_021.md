# 11.4.1. Summary

11.4.1. Summary

PIO instructions are 16 bits long, and use the following encoding:

*Table 980. PIO All PIO instructions execute in one clock cycle.*

The function of the 5-bit Delay/side-set field depends on the state machine’s SIDESET_COUNT configuration:

• Up to 5 LSBs (5 minus SIDESET_COUNT) encode a number of idle cycles inserted between this instruction and the next.

• Up to 5 MSBs, set by SIDESET_COUNT, encode a side-set (Section 11.5.1), which can assert a constant onto some

GPIOs, concurrently with main instruction execution.
