12.15.3. TBMAN

TBMAN refers to the testbench manager, used during chip development simulations to verify the design. During these

simulations TBMAN allows software running on RP2350 to control the testbench and simulation environment. On the

real chip, it has no effect other than providing a single PLATFORM register that indicates that this is the real chip. This

PLATFORM functionality is duplicated in the sysinfo (Section 12.15.1) registers.
