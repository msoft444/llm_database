# 12.8.3. Alarms

12.8.3. Alarms

The timer has 4 alarms, and outputs a separate interrupt for each alarm. The alarms match on the lower 32 bits of the

64-bit counter, which means they can be fired at a maximum of 232 microseconds into the future. This is equivalent to:

• 232 ÷ 106: ~4295 seconds
• 4295 ÷ 60: ~72 minutes
