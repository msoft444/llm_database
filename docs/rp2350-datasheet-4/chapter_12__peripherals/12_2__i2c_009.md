# 12.2. I2C

![Page 984 figure](images/fig_p0984.png)

Synopsys Proprietary. Used with permission.

I2C is a commonly used 2-wire interface that can be used to connect devices for low speed data transfer using clock SCL

and data SDA wires.

RP2350 has two identical instances of an I2C controller. The external pins of each controller are connected to GPIO pins

as defined in the GPIO muxing table in Section 9.4. The muxing options give some IO flexibility.
