GPIO functions are also available on the six dedicated QSPI pins, which are usually used for flash execute-in-place, and

on the USB DP/DM pins. These may become available for general-purpose use depending on the use case, for example,

QSPI pins may not be needed for code execution if RP2350 is booting from internal OTP storage, or being controlled
