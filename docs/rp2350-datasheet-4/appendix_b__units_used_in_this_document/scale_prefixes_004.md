# Scale Prefixes

Scale Prefixes

The standard SI prefixes used in the previous sections are:

• G: giga, factor of 109 (one short billion)
• M: mega, factor of 106 (one million)
• k: kilo, factor of 103 (one thousand)
• c: centi, factor of 10-2 (one hundredth)
• m: milli, factor of 10-3 (one thousandth)
• μ, micro, factor of 10-6 (one millionth)
• n: nano, factor of 10-9 (one short billionth)
• p: pico, factor of 10-12 (one short trillionth)

The customary binary prefixes used in the memory and storage capacity section are:

• G: giga, factor of 230 (approximately 109)
• M: mega, factor of 220 (approximately 106)
• k: kilo, factor of 210 (approximately 103)

These customary binary prefixes are equivalent to the following prefixes from IEC 60027-2:

• Gi, gibi
• Mi, mebi
• Ki, kibi
