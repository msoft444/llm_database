7.3.3. Chip-level reset sources

In order of severity, the following events can trigger a chip-level reset:

Power-On Reset (POR)

The power-on reset ensures the chip starts up cleanly when power is first applied by holding it in reset until the

digital core supply (DVDD) reaches a voltage high enough to reliably power the chip’s core logic. The POR

component is described in detail in Section 7.6.1, “Power-on reset (POR)”.
