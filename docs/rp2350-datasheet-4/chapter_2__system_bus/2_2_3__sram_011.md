# 2.2.3. SRAM

![Page 32 figure](images/fig_p0032.png)

SRAM is accessible to DMA, processor load/store, and processor instruction fetch.

SRAM0-3 and SRAM4-7 are always striped on bits 3:2 of the address:

| Bus Endpoint | Base Address |
| --- | --- |
| SRAM_BASE | 0x20000000 |
| SRAM_STRIPED_BASE | 0x20000000 |
| SRAM0_BASE | 0x20000000 |
| SRAM4_BASE | 0x20040000 |
| SRAM_STRIPED_END | 0x20080000 |

Table 11. Address

map for SRAM bus

segment, SRAM0-7

(striped)

There are two striped regions, each 256 kB in size, and each striped over 4 SRAM banks. SRAM0-3 are in the SRAM0

power domain, and SRAM4-7 are in the SRAM1 power domain.

SRAM 8-9 are always non-striped:

| Bus Endpoint | Base Address |
| --- | --- |
| SRAM8_BASE | 0x20080000 |
| SRAM9_BASE | 0x20081000 |
| SRAM_END | 0x20082000 |

(non-striped)

These smaller blocks of SRAM are useful for hoisting high-bandwidth data structures like the processor stacks. They

are in the SRAM1 power domain.
