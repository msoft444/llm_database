3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors

The Cortex-M33 features a coprocessor port which transfers up to 64 bits per cycle between the processor and certain

closely-coupled hardware. The Cortex-M33’s built-in floating-point unit is an example of such a coprocessor, but

RP2350 adds three device-specific coprocessors to this interface. The following sections document these

coprocessors.
