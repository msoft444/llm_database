# 3.8.5. Debug

3.8.5. Debug

RISC-V debug specification

Hazard3 implements version 0.13.2 of the RISC-V External Debug Support specification, available at:

riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/riscv-debug-release.pdf

RP2350 implements a single RISC-V Debug Module, which enables debug access to the two Hazard3 processor

instances. Hazard3 should be supported by any debug translator implementing version 0.13.2 of the RISC-V External

Debug Support specification, but some details of its implementation-defined behaviour are described here for

completeness. The Debug Module source code, available in the Hazard3 repository, can be consulted to answer more

detailed questions about the debug implementation.

As configured on RP2350, Hazard3 supports the following standard RISC-V debug features:

• Run/halt/reset control of each processor
• Halt-on-reset support for all processors
• Hart array mask register, for halting/resuming multiple processors simultaneously
• Abstract access to GPRs
• Program Buffer: 2 words with an implicit ebreak (impebreak)
• Automatic trigger of abstract commands (abstractauto)
• System Bus Access, arbitrated with core 1’s load/store port
• An instruction address trigger unit with four hardware breakpoints

3.8.5.1. Accessing the Debug Module

The Debug Module is accessed through a CoreSight APB-AP, which can be accessed in one of two ways:

• Externally, through the system’s SW-DP (see Section 3.5)
• Internally, via self-hosted debug (see Section 3.5.6)

The APB-AP for the Debug Module is located at offset 0xa000 in the debug address space. The Debug Module starts at

address 0 in the APB-AP’s downstream address space. The Debug Module addresses registers in increments of four

bytes, as APB is byte-addressed rather than word-addressed. This means the Debug Module register addresses listed in

the RISC-V debug specification must be multiplied by four.
