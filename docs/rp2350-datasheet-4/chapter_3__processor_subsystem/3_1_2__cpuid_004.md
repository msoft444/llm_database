# 3.1.2. CPUID

3.1.2. CPUID

The CPUID SIO register returns a value of 0 when read by core 0, and 1 when read by core 1. This helps software identify

the core running the current application. The initial boot sequence also relies on this check: both cores start running

simultaneously, core 1 goes into a deep sleep state, and core 0 continues the main boot sequence.

IMPORTANT

Don’t confuse the SIO CPUID register with the Cortex-M33 CPUID register on each processor’s internal Private

Peripheral Bus, which lists the processor’s part number and version.
