MOV PC causes an unconditional jump. MOV EXEC has the same behaviour as OUT EXEC (Section 11.4.5), and allows register

contents to be executed as an instruction. The MOV itself executes in 1 cycle, and the instruction in Source on the next

cycle. Delay cycles on MOV EXEC are ignored, but the executee may insert delay cycles as normal.

The STATUS source has a value of all-ones or all-zeroes, depending on some state machine status such as FIFO

full/empty, configured by EXECCTRL_STATUS_SEL.

MOV can manipulate the transferred data in limited ways, specified by the Operation argument. Invert sets each bit in

Destination to the logical NOT of the corresponding bit in Source, i.e. 1 bits become 0 bits, and vice versa. Bit reverse sets

each bit n in Destination to bit 31 - n in Source, assuming the bits are numbered 0 to 31.

MOV dst, PINS reads pins using the IN pin mapping, masked to the number of bits specified by SHIFTCTRL_IN_COUNT. The LSB

of the read value is the pin indicated by PINCTRL_IN_BASE, and each successive bit comes from a higher-numbered pin,

wrapping after 31. Result bits greater than the width specified by SHIFTCTRL_IN_COUNT configuration are 0.

MOV PINDIRS, src is not supported on PIO version 0.
