# 11.5.7. Forced and EXEC’d instructions

11.5.7. Forced and EXEC’d instructions

Besides the instruction memory, state machines can execute instructions from 3 other sources:

• MOV EXEC which executes an instruction from some register Source
• OUT EXEC which executes data shifted out from the OSR
• The SMx_INSTR control registers, to which the system can write instructions for immediate execution

 1 .program exec_example

 2 

 3 hang:

 4     jmp hang

 5 execute:

 6     out exec, 32

 7     jmp execute

 8 

 9 .program instructions_to_push

10 

11     out x, 32

12     in x, 32

13     push

24     mm_pio->sm[0].instr = 0x0000 | 0x1; // jmp execute

25 

26     // Feed a mixture of instructions and data into FIFO

27     mm_pio->txf[0] = instructions_to_push_program[0]; // out x, 32

28     mm_pio->txf[0] = 12345678;                        // data to be OUTed

29     mm_pio->txf[0] = instructions_to_push_program[1]; // in x, 32

30     mm_pio->txf[0] = instructions_to_push_program[2]; // push

31 

32     // The program pushed into TX FIFO will return some data in RX FIFO

33     while (mm_pio->fstat & (1u << PIO_FSTAT_RXEMPTY_LSB))

34         ;

35 

36     printf("%d\n", mm_pio->rxf[0]);

37

39 }

Here we load an example program into the state machine, which does two things:

• Enters an infinite loop
• Enters a loop which repeatedly pulls 32 bits of data from the TX FIFO, and executes the lower 16 bits as an

instruction

The C program sets the state machine running, at which point it enters the hang loop. While the state machine is still

running, the C program forces in a jmp instruction, which causes the state machine to break out of the loop.

When an instruction is written to the INSTR register, the state machine immediately decodes and executes that

instruction, rather than the instruction it would have fetched from the PIO’s instruction memory. The program counter

does not advance, so on the next cycle (assuming the instruction forced into the INSTR interface did not stall) the state

machine continues to execute its current program from the point where it left off, unless the written instruction itself

manipulated PC.

Delay cycles are ignored on instructions written to the INSTR register, and execute immediately, ignoring the state

machine clock divider. This interface is provided for performing initial setup and effecting control flow changes, so it

executes instructions in a timely manner, no matter how the state machine is configured.

Instructions written to the INSTR register are permitted to stall, in which case the state machine will latch this instruction

internally until it completes. This is signified by the EXECCTRL_EXEC_STALLED flag. This can be cleared by restarting the state
