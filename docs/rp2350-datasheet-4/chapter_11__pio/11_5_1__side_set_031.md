# 11.5.1. Side-set

11.5.1. Side-set

Side-set is a feature that allows state machines to change the level or direction of up to 5 pins, concurrently with the

main execution of the instruction.

One example where this is necessary is a fast SPI interface: here a clock transition (toggling 1→0 or 0→1) must be

simultaneous with a data transition, where a new data bit is shifted from the OSR to a GPIO. In this case an OUT with a

side-set would achieve both of these at once.

This makes the timing of the interface more precise, reduces the overall program size (as a separate SET instruction is

not needed to toggle the clock pin), and also increases the maximum frequency the SPI can run at.

Side-set also makes GPIO mapping much more flexible, as its mapping is independent from SET. The example I2C code

allows SDA and SCL to be mapped to any two arbitrary pins, if clock stretching is disabled. Normally, SCL toggles to

synchronise data transfer, and SDA contains the data bits being shifted out. However, some particular I2C sequences

such as Start and Stop line conditions, need a fixed pattern to be driven on SDA as well as SCL. The mapping I2C uses to

achieve this is:

• Side-set → SCL
