5.4.8. API function listings

5.4.8.1. bootrom_state_reset

Code: 'S','R'

Signature: void bootrom_state_reset(uint32_t flags)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V

Resets internal bootrom state, based on the following flags:

• 0x0001 : STATE_RESET_CURRENT_CORE - Resets any internal bootrom state for the current core to a known state. This

method should be called prior to calling any other bootrom APIs on the current core, and is called automatically by

the bootrom during normal boot of core 0 or launch of code on core 1.
• 0x0002 : STATE_RESET_OTHER_CORE - Resets any internal bootrom state for the other core into a clean state. This is

generally called by a debugger when resetting the state of one core via code running on the other.
• 0x0004 : STATE_RESET_GLOBAL_STATE - Resets all non core-specific state, including:

◦Disables access to bootrom APIs from Arm-NS (see also set_ns_api_permission()).

◦Unlocks all boot locks (Section 5.4.4).

◦Clears any Secure code callbacks. (see also set_rom_callback())

Note that the SDK calls this method on runtime initialisation to put the boot RO into a known state. This allows the

program to function correctly if it is entered via a debugger, or otherwise without taking the usual boot path through the

bootrom, which itself would reset the state.

5.4.8.2. chain_image

Code: 'C','I'

Signature: int chain_image(uint8_t *workarea_base, uint32_t workarea_size, int32_t region_base, uint32_t region_size)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V. Note on RISC-V this function may require additional stack; see Section 5.4.8.26.

Returns: BOOTROM_OK (0) on success, or a negative error code on error.

Searches a memory region for a launchable image, and executes it if possible.

The region_base and region_size specify a word-aligned, word-multiple-sized area of RAM, XIP RAM or flash to search.

The first 4 kB of the region must contain the start of a block loop with an IMAGE_DEF. If the new image is launched, the call

does not return otherwise an error is returned.

The region_base is signed, as a negative value can be passed, which indicates that the (negated back to positive value) is

both the region_base and the base of the "flash update" region.

This method potentially requires similar complexity to the boot path in terms of picking amongst versions, checking

signatures etc. As a result it requires a user provided memory buffer as a work area. The work area should be word

aligned, and of sufficient size or BOOTROM_ERROR_BAD_ALIGNMENT / BOOTROM_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES will be returned. The

work area size currently required is 3064, so 3 kB is a good choice.

This method is primarily expected to be used when implementing bootloaders.

NOTE

When chaining into an image, the BOOT_FLAGS0.ROLLBACK_REQUIRED flag will not be set, to prevent invalidating a

bootloader without a rollback version by booting a binary which has one (see Section 5.10.8).

5.4.8.3. connect_internal_flash

Code: 'I','F'

Signature: void connect_internal_flash(void)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V

Restores all QSPI pad controls to their default state, and connects the QMI peripheral to the QSPI pads.

If a secondary flash chip select GPIO has been configured via OTP FLASH_DEVINFO, or by writing to the runtime copy of

FLASH_DEVINFO in boot RAM, then this bank 0 GPIO is also initialised and the QMI peripheral is connected. Otherwise, bank

0 IOs are untouched.

5.4.8.4. explicit_buy

Code: 'E','B'

Signature: int explicit_buy(uint8_t *buffer, uint32_t buffer_size)

Supported architectures: Arm-S RISC-V

Returns: BOOTROM_OK (0) on success, negative error code on error.

Perform an "explicit buy" of an executable launched via an IMAGE_DEF which was TBYB (Section 5.1.17) flagged. A "flash

update" boot of such an image is a way to have the image execute once, but only become the "current" image if it safely

calls back into the bootrom via this call.

This call may perform the following:

• Erase and rewrite the part of flash containing the TBYB flag in order to clear said flag.

5.4. Bootrom APIs
384

RP2350 Datasheet

• Erase the first sector of the other partition in an A/B partition scenario, if this new IMAGE_DEF is a version downgrade

(so this image will boot again when not doing a normal boot)
• Update the rollback version in OTP if the chip is secure, and a rollback version is present in the image.

The first of the above requires 4 kB of scratch space, so you should pass a word aligned buffer of at least 4 kB to this

method in this case, or BOOTROM_ERROR_BAD_ALIGNMENT / BOOTROM_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES will be returned.

The device might reboot while updating the rollback version if multiple rollback rows need to be written. This occurs

when the version crosses a multiple of 24 (for example, upgrading from version 23 to 25 requires a reboot, but 23 to 24

or 24 to 25 doesn’t). The application must therefore be prepared to reboot when calling this function if rollback versions

are in use.

5.4.8.5. flash_devinfo16-ptr

Code: 'F','D'

Type: uint16_t *flash_devinfo16_ptr

Pointer to the flash device info used by the flash APIs, for example, for bounds checking against size of flash devices,

and configuring the GPIO used for secondary QSPI chip select.

If BOOT_FLAGS0.FLASH_DEVINFO_ENABLE is set, this boot RAM location is initialised from FLASH_DEVINFO at startup,

otherwise it is initialised to:

• Chip select 0 size: 16 MB
• Chip select 1 size: 0 bytes
• No chip select 1 GPIO
• No D8h erase command support

The flash APIs use this boot RAM copy of FLASH_DEVINFO, so flash device info can updated by Secure code at runtime by

writing through this pointer.

5.4.8.6. flash_enter_cmd_xip

Code: 'C','X'

Signature: void flash_enter_cmd_xip(void)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V

Compatibility alias for flash_select_xip_read_mode(0, 12);.

Configure the QMI to generate a standard 03h serial read command, with 24 address bits, upon each XIP access. This is

a slow XIP configuration, but is widely supported. CLKDIV is set to 12. The debugger may call this function to ensure

that flash is readable following a program/erase operation.

Note that the same setup is performed by flash_exit_xip(), and the RP2350 flash program/erase functions do not leave

XIP in an inaccessible state, so calls to this function are largely redundant. It is provided for compatibility with RP2040.

5.4.8.7. flash_exit_xip

Code: 'E','X'

Signature: void flash_exit_xip(void)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V

Initialise the QMI for serial operations (direct mode), and also initialise a basic XIP mode, where the QMI will perform

03h serial read commands at low speed (CLKDIV=12) in response to XIP reads.

5.4. Bootrom APIs
385

RP2350 Datasheet

Then, issue a sequence to the QSPI device on chip select 0, designed to return it from continuous read mode ("XIP

mode") and/or QPI mode to a state where it will accept serial commands. This is necessary after system reset to

restore the QSPI device to a known state, because resetting RP2350 does not reset attached QSPI devices. It is also

necessary when user code, having already performed some continuous-read-mode or QPI-mode accesses, wishes to

return the QSPI device to a state where it will accept the serial erase and programming commands issued by the

bootrom’s flash access functions.

If a GPIO for the secondary chip select is configured via FLASH_DEVINFO, then the XIP exit sequence is also issued to chip

select 1.

The QSPI device should be accessible for XIP reads after calling this function; the name flash_exit_xip refers to

returning the QSPI device from its XIP state to a serial command state.

5.4.8.8. flash_flush_cache

Code: 'F','C'

Signature: void flash_flush_cache(void)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V

Flush the entire XIP cache, by issuing an invalidate by set/way maintenance operation to every cache line (Section

4.4.1). This ensures that flash program/erase operations are visible to subsequent cached XIP reads.

Note that this unpins pinned cache lines, which may interfere with cache-as-SRAM use of the XIP cache.

No other operations are performed.

5.4.8.9. flash_op

Code: 'F','O'

Signature: int flash_op(uint32_t flags, uint32_t addr, uint32_t size_bytes, uint8_t *buf)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, Arm-NS, RISC-V

Returns: BOOTROM_OK (0) on success, negative error code on error.

Perform a flash read, erase, or program operation. Erase operations must be sector-aligned (4096 bytes) and sector-

multiple-sized, and program operations must be page-aligned (256 bytes) and page-multiple-sized; misaligned erase

and program operations will return BOOTROM_ERROR_BAD_ALIGNMENT. The operation — erase, read, program — is selected by

the CFLASH_OP_BITS bitfield of the flags argument:

flags is comprised of the following values:

| Address Translation (s | elect one) |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000000 | No address translation; addr arg is the actual flash storage addresses. |
| 0x00000001 | Runtime address translation; addr arg is XIP memory address affected by address translation. |
| Security level (select o | ne) |
| 0x00000100 | Perform the operation using secure permissions. This is disallowed for a non-secure caller. |
| 0x00000200 | Perform the operation using non-secure permissions. |
| 0x00000300 | Perform the operation using boot-loader permissions. This is disallowed for a non-secure caller. |
| Operation (select one) |  |
| 0x00000000 | Erase size bytes bytes of flash, starting at address addr. Both addr and size bytes must be a _ _ multiple of 4096 bytes (one flash sector). |

5.4. Bootrom APIs
386

RP2350 Datasheet

| 0x00010000 | Program size bytes bytes of flash, starting at address addr. Both addr and size bytes must be a _ _ multiple of 256 bytes (one flash page). |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00020000 | Read size bytes bytes of flash, starting at address addr. There are no alignment restrictions on _ addr or size bytes. _ |

These constants are also available in bootrom_constants.h in the SDK as #defines.

addr is the address of the first flash byte to be accessed, ranging from XIP_BASE to XIP_BASE + 0x1ffffff inclusive. This may

be a runtime or storage address. buf contains data to be written to flash, for program operations, and data read back

from flash, for read operations. buf is never written by program operations, and is completely ignored for erase

operations.

The flash operation is bounds-checked against the known flash devices specified by the runtime value of FLASH_DEVINFO,

stored 
in 
boot 
RAM. 
This 
is 
initialised 
by 
the 
bootrom 
to 
the 
OTP 
value 
FLASH_DEVINFO, 
if

BOOT_FLAGS0.FLASH_DEVINFO_ENABLE is set; otherwise it is initialised to 16 MB for chip select 0 and 0 bytes for chip

select 1. FLASH_DEVINFO can be updated at runtime by writing to its location in boot RAM, the pointer to which can be

looked up in the ROM table.

If a resident partition table is in effect, then the flash operation is also checked against the partition permissions. The

Secure version of this function can specify the caller’s effective security level (Secure, Non-secure, bootloader) using

the CFLASH_SECLEVEL_BITS bitfield of the flags argument, whereas the Non-secure function is always checked against the

Non-secure permissions for the partition. Flash operations which span two partitions are not allowed, and will fail

address validation.

If FLASH_DEVINFO.D8H_ERASE_SUPPORTED is set, erase operations will use a D8h 64 kB block erase command where

possible (without erasing outside the specified region), for faster erase time. Otherwise, only 20h 4 kB sector erase

commands are used.

Optionally, this API can translate addr from flash runtime addresses to flash storage addresses, according to the

translation currently configured by QMI address translation registers, ATRANS0 through ATRANS7. For example, an

image stored at a +2 MB offset in flash (but mapped at XIP address 0 at runtime), writing to an offset of +1 MB into the

image, will write to a physical flash storage address of 3 MB. Translation is enabled by setting the corresponding bitfield

in the flags argument.

When translation is enabled, flash operations that cross address holes in the XIP runtime address space (created by

non-maximum ATRANSx_SIZE) will return an error response. This check may tear: the transfer may be partially performed

before encountering an address hole and ultimately returning failure.

When translation is enabled, flash operations are permitted to cross chip select boundaries, provided this does not span

an ATRANS address hole. When translation is disabled, the entire operation must target a single flash chip select (as

determined by bits 24 and upward of the address), else address validation will fail.

A typical call sequence for erasing a flash sector in the runtime address space from Secure code would be:

• connect_internal_flash();
• flash_exit_xip();
• flash_op((CFLASH_OP_VALUE_ERASE << CFLASH_OP_LSB) | (CFLASH_SECLEVEL_VALUE_SECURE << CFLASH_SECLEVEL_LSB) |

(CFLASH_ASPACE_VALUE_RUNTIME << CFLASH_ASPACE_LSB), addr, 4096, NULL);
• flash_flush_cache();
• Copy the XIP setup function from boot RAM to SRAM and execute it, to restore the original XIP mode

◦The bootrom will have written a default setup function which restores the mode/clkdiv parameters found

during flash search; user code can overwrite this with its own custom setup function.

A similar sequence is required for program operations. Read operations can leave the current XIP mode in effect, so

only the flash_op(…); call is required.

Note that the RP2350 bootrom leaves the flash in a basic XIP state in between program/erase operations. However,

during a program/erase operation, the QMI is in direct mode (Section 12.14.5) and any attempted XIP access will return

5.4. Bootrom APIs
387

RP2350 Datasheet

a bus error response.

5.4.8.10. flash_range_erase

Code: 'R','E'

Signature: void flash_range_erase(uint32_t addr, size_t count, uint32_t block_size, uint8_t block_cmd)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V

Erase count bytes, starting at addr (offset from start of flash). Optionally, pass a block erase command (for example, D8h

block erase), and the size of the block erased by this command — this function will use the larger block erase where

possible, for much higher erase speed. addr must be aligned to a 4096-byte sector, and count must be a multiple of 4096

bytes.

This is a low-level flash API, and no validation of the arguments is performed. See flash_op() for a higher-level API which

checks alignment, flash bounds and partition permissions, and can transparently apply a runtime-to-storage address

translation.

The QSPI device must be in a serial command state before calling this API, which can be achieved by calling

connect_internal_flash() followed by flash_exit_xip(). After the erase, the flash cache should be flushed via

flash_flush_cache() to ensure the modified flash data is visible to cached XIP accesses.

Finally, the original XIP mode should be restored by copying the saved XIP setup function from boot RAM into SRAM,

and executing it: the bootrom provides a default function which restores the flash mode/clkdiv discovered during flash

scanning, and user programs can override this with their own XIP setup function.

For the duration of the erase operation, QMI is in direct mode (Section 12.14.5) and attempting to access XIP from

DMA, the debugger or the other core will return a bus fault. XIP becomes accessible again once the function returns.

5.4.8.11. flash_range_program

Code: 'R','P'

Signature: void flash_range_program(uint32_t addr, const uint8_t *data, size_t count)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V

Program data to a range of flash storage addresses starting at addr (offset from the start of flash) and count bytes in

size. addr must be aligned to a 256-byte boundary, and count must be a multiple of 256.

This is a low-level flash API, and no validation of the arguments is performed. See flash_op() for a higher-level API which

checks alignment, flash bounds and partition permissions, and can transparently apply a runtime-to-storage address

translation.

The QSPI device must be in a serial command state before calling this API — see notes on flash_range_erase().

5.4.8.12. flash_reset_address_trans

Code: 'R','A'

Signature: void flash_reset_address_trans(void)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V

Restore the QMI address translation registers, ATRANS0 through ATRANS7, to their reset state. This makes the runtime-

to-storage address map an identity map, meaning the mapped and unmapped address are equal, and the entire space is

fully mapped. See Section 12.14.4.

5.4. Bootrom APIs
388

RP2350 Datasheet

5.4.8.13. flash_runtime_to_storage_addr

Code: 'F','A'

Signature: int flash_runtime_to_storage_addr(uint32_t addr)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, Arm-NS, RISC-V

Returns: A positive value on success (the translated address), or negative error code on error

Applies the address translation currently configured by QMI address translation registers, ATRANS0 through ATRANS7.

See Section 12.14.4.

Translating an address outside of the XIP runtime address window, or beyond the bounds of an ATRANSx_SIZE field,

returns BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS, which is not a valid flash storage address. Otherwise, return the storage address

which QMI would access when presented with the runtime address addr. This is effectively a virtual-to-physical address

translation for QMI.

5.4.8.14. flash_select_xip_read_mode

Code: 'X','M'

Signature: void flash_select_xip_read_mode(bootrom_xip_mode_t mode, uint8_t clkdiv)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V

Configure QMI for one of a small menu of XIP read modes supported by the bootrom. This mode is configured for both

memory windows (both chip selects), and the clock divisor is also applied to direct mode.

The available modes are:

• 0: 03h serial read: serial address, serial data, no wait cycles
• 1: 0Bh serial read: serial address, serial data, 8 wait cycles
• 2: BBh dual-IO read: dual address, dual data, 4 wait cycles (including MODE bits, which are driven to 0)
• 3: EBh quad-IO read: quad address, quad data, 6 wait cycles (including MODE bits, which are driven to 0)

The XIP write command/format are not configured by this function.

When booting from flash, the bootrom tries each of these modes in turn, from 3 down to 0. The first mode that is found

to work is remembered, and a default XIP setup function is written into boot RAM that calls this function

(flash_select_xip_read_mode) with the parameters discovered during flash scanning. This can be called at any time to

restore the flash parameters discovered during flash boot.

All XIP modes configured by the bootrom have an 8-bit serial command prefix, so that the flash device can remain in a

serial command state, meaning XIP accesses can be mixed more freely with program/erase serial operations. This has

a performance penalty, so users can perform their own flash setup after flash boot using continuous read mode or QPI

mode to avoid or alleviate the command prefix cost.

5.4.8.15. get_b_partition

Code: 'G','B'

Signature: int get_b_partition(uint partition_a)

Supported architectures: Arm-S RISC-V

Returns: The index of the B partition of partition A if a partition table is present and loaded, and there is a partition A with

a corresponding B partition; otherwise returns BOOTROM_ERROR_NOT_FOUND.

5.4. Bootrom APIs
389

RP2350 Datasheet

5.4.8.16. get_partition_table_info

Code: 'G','P'

Signature: int get_partition_table_info(uint32_t *out_buffer, uint32_t out_buffer_word_size, uint32_t flags_and_partition)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, Arm-NS, RISC-V

Returns: >= 0 on success (the number of words filled in out_buffer), negative error code on error.

Fills a buffer with information from the partition table. Note that this API is also used to return information over the

PICOBOOT interface.

On success, the buffer is filled, and the number of words filled in the buffer is returned. If the partition table hasn’t been

loaded (for example, from a watchdog or RAM boot), this method returns BOOTROM_ERROR_PRECONDITION_NOT_MET, and you

should load the partition table through load_partition_table() first.

Not all data from the partition table is kept resident in memory by the bootrom due to size constraints. To protect

against changes being made in flash after the bootrom has loaded the resident portion, the bootrom keeps a hash of

the partition table as of the time it loaded it. If the hash has changed by the time this method is called, then it will return

BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_STATE.

The information returned is chosen by the flags_and_partition parameter; the first word in the returned buffer, is the

(sub)set of those flags that the API supports. You should always check this value before interpreting the buffer.

Following the first word, returns words of data for each present flag in order. With the exception of PT_INFO, all the flags

select "per partition" information, so each field is returned in flag order for one partition after the next. The special

SINGLE_PARTITION flag indicates that data for only a single partition is required. Flags include:

• 0x0001 - PT_INFO : information about the partition table as a whole. The second two words for unpartitioned space in

the same form described in Section 5.9.4.2.

◦Word 0 : partition_count (low 8 bits), partition_table_present (bit 8)

◦Word 1 : unpartitioned_space_permissions_and_location

◦Word 2 : unpartitioned_space_permissions_and_flags
• 0x8000 - SINGLE_PARTITION : only return data for a single partition; the partition number is stored in the top 8 bits of

flags_and_partition

Per-partition fields:

• 0x0010 - PARTITION_LOCATION_AND_FLAGS : the core information about a partition. The format of these fields is described

in Section 5.9.4.2.

◦Word 0 - permissions_and_location

◦Word 1 - permissions_and_flags
• 0x0020 - PARTITION_ID : the optional 64-bit identifier for the partition. If the HAS_ID bit is set in the partition flags, then

the 64 bit ID is returned:

◦Word 0 - first 32 bits

◦Word 1 - second 32 bits
• 0x0040 - PARTITION_FAMILY_IDS : Any additional UF2 family IDs that the partition supports being downloaded into it via

the MSD bootloader beyond the standard ones flagged in the permissions_and_flags field (see Section 5.9.4.2).
• 0x0080 - PARTITION_NAME : The optional name for the partition. If the HAS_NAME field bit in permissions_and_flags is not set,

then no data is returned for this partition; otherwise the format is as follows:

◦Byte 0 : 7 bit length of the name (LEN); top bit reserved

◦Byte 1 : first character of name

◦…

5.4. Bootrom APIs
390

RP2350 Datasheet

◦Byte LEN : last character of name

◦… (padded up to the next word boundary)

NOTE

Unpartitioned space is always reported in Word 1 as having a base offset of 0x0 and a size of 0x2000 sectors (32 MB).

The bootrom applies unpartitioned space permissions to any flash storage address that is not covered by a partition.

5.4.8.17. get_sys_info

Code: 'G','S'

Signature: int get_sys_info(uint32_t *out_buffer, uint32_t out_buffer_word_size, uint32_t flags)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, Arm-NS, RISC-V

Returns: A positive value on success (the number of words filled in out_buffer), negative error code on error.

Fills a buffer with various system information. Note that this API is also used to return information over the PICOBOOT

interface.

The information returned is chosen by the flags parameter; the first word in the returned buffer, is the (sub)set of those

flags that the API supports. You should always check this value before interpreting the buffer.

Following the first word, returns words of data for each present flag in order:

• 0x0001 : CHIP_INFO - unique identifier for the chip (3 words)

◦Word 0 : Value of the CHIP_INFO_PACKAGE_SEL register

◦Word 1 : RP2350 device id low

◦Word 2 : RP2350 device id high
• 0x0002 : CRITICAL (1 word)

◦Word 0 : Value of the OTP CRITICAL register, containing critical boot flags read out on last OTP reset event
• 0x0004 : CPU_INFO (1 word)

◦Word 0 : Current CPU architecture

▪0 - Arm

▪1 - RISC-V
• 0x0008 : FLASH_DEV_INFO (1 word)

◦Word 0 : Flash device info in the format of OTP FLASH_DEVINFO
• 0x0010 : BOOT_RANDOM - a 128-bit random number generated on each boot (4 words)

◦Word 0 : Per boot random number 0

◦Word 1 : Per boot random number 1

◦Word 2 : Per boot random number 2

◦Word 3 : Per boot random number 3
• 0x0020 : NONCE - not supported
• 0x0040 : BOOT_INFO (4 words)

◦Word 0 : 0xttppbbdd

▪tt - recent boot TBYB and update info (updated on regular non BOOTSEL boots)

5.4. Bootrom APIs
391

RP2350 Datasheet

▪pp - recent boot partition (updated on regular not BOOTSEL boots)

▪bb - boot type of the most recent boot

▪dd - recent boot diagnostic "partition"

◦Word 1 : Recent boot diagnostic. Diagnostic information from a recent boot (with information from the

partition (or slot) indicated by dd above. "partition" numbers here are:

▪0-15 : a partition number

▪-1 : none

▪-2 : slot 0

▪-3 : slot 1

▪-4 : image (the diagnostic came from the launch of a RAM image, OTP boot image or user chain_image()

call).

◦Word 2 : Last reboot param 0

◦Word 3 : Last reboot param 1

"Boot Diagnostic" information is intended to help identify the cause of a failed boot, or booting into an unexpected

binary. This information can be retrieved via PICOBOOT after a watchdog reboot, however it will not survive a reset via

the RUN pin or POWMAN reset.

There is only one word of diagnostic information. What it records is based on the pp selection above, which is itself set

as a parameter when rebooting programmatically into a normal boot.

To get diagnostic info, pp must refer to a slot or an "A" partition; image diagnostics are automatically selected on boot

from OTP or RAM image, or when chain_image() is called.)

The diagnostic word thus contains data for either slot 0 and slot 1, or the "A" partition (and its "B" partition if it has one).

The low half word of the diagnostic word contains information from slot 0 or partition A; the high half word contains

information from slot 1 or partition B.

The format of each half-word is as follows (using the word region to refer to slot or partition)

• 0x0001 : REGION_SEARCHED - The region was searched for a block loop.
• 0x0002 : INVALID_BLOCK_LOOP - A block loop was found but it was invalid
• 0x0004 : VALID_BLOCK_LOOP - A valid block loop was found (Blocks from a loop wholly contained within the region, and

the blocks have the correct structure. Each block consists of items whose sizes sum to the size of the block)
• 0x0008 : VALID_IMAGE_DEF - A valid IMAGE_DEF was found in the region. A valid IMAGE_DEF must parse correctly and must

be executable.
• 0x0010 : HAS_PARTITION_TABLE - Whether a partition table is present. This partition table must have a correct structure

formed if VALID_BLOCK_LOOP is set. If the partition table turns out to be invalid, then INVALID_BLOCK_LOOP is set too (thus

both VALID_BLOCK_LOOP and INVALID_BLOCK_LOOP will both be set).
• 0x0020 : CONSIDERED - There was a choice of partition/slot and this one was considered. The first slot/partition is

chosen based on a number of factors. If the first choice fails verification, then the other choice will be considered.

◦the version of the PARTITION_TABLE/IMAGE_DEF present in the slot/partition respectively.

◦whether the slot/partition is the "update region" as per a FLASH_UPDATE reboot.

◦whether an IMAGE_DEF is marked as "explicit buy"
• 0x0040 : CHOSEN - This slot/partition was chosen (or was the only choice)
• 0x0080 : PARTITION_TABLE_MATCHING_KEY_FOR_VERIFY - if a signature is required for the PARTITION_TABLE (via OTP setting),

then whether the PARTITION_TABLE is signed with a key matching one of the four stored in OTP
• 0x0100 : PARTITION_TABLE_HASH_FOR_VERIFY - set if a hash value check could be performed. In the case a signature is

required, this value is identical to PARTITION_TABLE_MATCHING_KEY_FOR_VERIFY

• 0x0200 : PARTITION_TABLE_VERIFIED_OK - whether the PARTITION_TABLE passed verification (signature/hash if

present/required)
• 0x0400 : IMAGE_DEF_MATCHING_KEY_FOR_VERIFY - if a signature is required for the IMAGE_DEF due to secure boot, then

whether the IMAGE_DEF is signed with a key matching one of the four stored in OTP.
• 0x0800 : IMAGE_DEF_HASH_FOR_VERIFY - set if a hash value check could be performed. In the case a signature is required,

this value is identical to IMAGE_DEF_MATCHING_KEY_FOR_VERIFY
• 0x1000 : IMAGE_DEF_VERIFIED_OK - whether the PARTITION_TABLE passed verification (signature/hash if present/required)

and any LOAD_MAP is valid
• 0x2000 : LOAD_MAP_ENTRIES_LOADED - whether any code was copied into RAM due to a LOAD_MAP
• 0x4000 : IMAGE_LAUNCHED - whether an IMAGE_DEF from this region was launched
• 0x8000 : IMAGE_CONDITION_FAILURE - whether the IMAGE_DEF failed final checks before launching; these checks include:

◦verification failed (if it hasn’t been verified earlier in the CONSIDERED phase).

◦a problem occurred setting up any rolling window.

◦the rollback version could not be set in OTP (if required in Secure mode)

◦the image was marked as Non-secure

◦the image was marked as "explicit buy", and this was a flash boot, but then region was not the "flash update"

region

◦the image has the wrong architecture, but architecture auto-switch is disabled (or the correct architecture is

disabled)

NOTE

The non-sensical combination of BOOT_DIAGNOSTIC_INVALID_BLOCK_LOOP and BOOT_DIAGNOSTIC_VALID_BLOCK_LOOP both being

set is used to flag a PARTITION_TABLE which passed the initial verification (and hash/sig), but was later discovered to

have invalid contents when it was fully parsed.

To get a full picture of a failed boot involving slots and multiple partitions, the device can be rebooted multiple times to

gather the information.

5.4.8.18. get_uf2_target_partition

Code: 'G','U'

Signature: 
int 
get_uf2_target_partition(uint8_t 
*workarea_base, 
uint32_t 
workarea_size, 
uint32_t 
family_id,

resident_partition_t *partition_out)

Supported architectures: Arm-S RISC-V. Note on RISC-V this function requires additional stack; see Section 5.4.8.26.

Returns: >= 0 on success (the target partition index), or a negative error code on error.

This method performs the same operation to decide on a taget partition for a UF2 family ID as when a UF2 is dragged

onto the USB drive in BOOTSEL mode.

This method potentially requires similar complexity to the boot path in terms of picking amongst versions, checking

signatures etc. As a result it requires a user provided memory buffer as a work area. The work area should byte word-

aligned and of sufficient size or BOOTROM_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES will be returned. The work area size currently

required is 3064, so 3K is a good choice.

If the partition table hasn’t been loaded (for example, from a watchdog or RAM boot), then this method returns

BOOTROM_ERROR_PRECONDITION_NOT_MET, and you should load the partition table via load_partition_table() first.

5.4.8.19. git_revision

Code: 'G','R'

Type: const uint32_t git_revision

The 8 most significant hex digits of the bootrom git revision. Uniquely identifies this version of the bootrom.

NOTE

This is the git revision built at chip tapeout; the git hash in the public repository is different due to squashed history,

even though the contents are identical. The contents can be verified by building the public bootrom source and

comparing the resulting binary with one binary dumped from the chip.

5.4.8.20. load_partition_table

Code: 'L','P'

Signature: int load_partition_table(uint8_t *workarea_base, uint32_t workarea_size, bool force_reload)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V. Note on RISC-V this function requires additional stack; see Section 5.4.8.26.

Returns: BOOTROM_OK (0) on success, or a negative error code on error.

Loads the current partition table from flash, if present.

This method potentially requires similar complexity to the boot path in terms of picking amongst versions, checking

signatures etc. As a result it requires a user provided memory buffer as a work area. The work area should byte word-

aligned and of sufficient size or BOOTROM_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES will be returned. The work area size currently

required is 3064, so 3K is a good choice.

If force_reload is false, then this method will return BOOTROM_OK immediately if the bootrom is loaded, otherwise it will

reload the partition table if it has been loaded already, allowing for the partition table to be updated in a running

program.

5.4.8.21. otp_access

Code: 'O','A'

Signature: int otp_access(uint8_t *buf, uint32_t buf_len, uint32_t row_and_flags)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, Arm-NS, RISC-V

Returns: BOOTROM_OK (0) on success, or a negative error code on error.

Writes data from a buffer into OTP, or reads data from OTP into a buffer.

• 0x0000ffff - ROW_NUMBER: 16 low bits are row number (0-4095)
• 0x00010000 - IS_WRITE: if set, do a write (not a read)
• 0x00020000 - IS_ECC: if this bit is set, each value in the buffer is 2 bytes and ECC is used when read/writing from 24 bit

value in OTP. If this bit is not set, each value in the buffer is 4 bytes, the low 24-bits of which are written to or read

from OTP.

The buffer must be aligned to 2 bytes or 4 bytes according to the IS_ECC flag.

This method will read and write rows until the first row it encounters that fails a key or permission check at which it will

return BOOTROM_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED.

Writing will also stop at the first row where an attempt is made to set an OTP bit from a 1 to a 0, and

BOOTROM_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_MODIFICATION will be returned.

If all rows are read/written successfully, then BOOTROM_OK will be returned.

5.4.8.22. partition_table_ptr

Code: 'P','T'

Type: resident_partition_table **partition_table_ptr

A pointer to the pointer to the resident partition table info. The resident partition table is the subset of the full partition

table that is kept in memory, and used for flash permissions.

The public part of the resident partition table info is of the form:

![Page 396 figure](images/fig_p0396.png)

1
partition_count_with_permissions (0-16). Set this to > partition_count when adding extra

permission regions at runtime (do not modify the original partitions)

1
loaded (0x01 if a partition table has been loaded from flash)

1
1
unpartitioned_space_permissions_and_flags

Details of the fields permissions_and_location and permissions_and_flags can be found in Section 5.9.4.

5.4.8.23. pick_ab_partition

Code: 'A','B'

Signature: int pick_ab_partition(uint8_t *workarea_base, uint32_t workarea_size, uint partition_a_num)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V. Note on RISC-V this function requires additional stack; see Section 5.4.8.26.

Returns: >= 0 on success (the partition index), or a negative error code on error.

Determines which of the partitions has the "better" IMAGE_DEF. In the case of executable images, this is the one that would

be booted

This method potentially requires similar complexity to the boot path in terms of picking amongst versions, checking

signatures etc. As a result it requires a user provided memory buffer as a work area. The work area should bye word

aligned, and of sufficient size or BOOTROM_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES will be returned. The work area size currently

required is 3064, so 3K is a good choice.

The passed partition number can be any valid partition number other than the "B" partition of an A/B pair.

This method returns a negative error code, or the partition number of the picked partition if (partition_a_num or the

number of its "B" partition if any).

NOTE

This method does not look at owner partitions, only the A partition passed and its corresponding B partition.

5.4.8.24. reboot

Code: 'R','B'

Signature: int reboot(uint32_t flags, uint32_t delay_ms, uint32_t p0, uint32_t p1)

Supported architectures: Arm-S, Arm-NS, RISC-V

Returns: BOOTROM_OK (or doesn’t return) on success, a negative error code on error.

Resets the RP2350 and uses the watchdog facility to restart.

The delay_ms is the millisecond delay before the reboot occurs. Note: by default this method is asynchronous (unless

NO_RETURN_ON_SUCCESS is set - see below), so the method will return and the reboot will happen this many milliseconds

later.

The flags field contains one of the following values:

• 0x0000 : REBOOT_TYPE_NORMAL - reboot into the normal boot path.

◦p0 - the boot diagnostic "partition" (low 8 bits only)
• 0x0002 : REBOOT_TYPE_BOOTSEL - reboot into BOOTSEL mode.

◦p0 - a set of flags:

▪0x01 : DISABLE_MSD_INTERFACE - Disable the BOOTSEL USB drive (see Section 5.5)

▪0x02 : DISABLE_PICOBOOT_INTERFACE - Disable the PICOBOOT interface (see Section 5.6).

▪0x10 : GPIO_PIN_ACTIVE_LOW - The GPIO in p1 is active low.

▪0x20 : GPIO_PIN_ENABLED - Enable the activity indicator on the specified GPIO.

◦p1 - the GPIO number to use as an activity indicator (enabled by flag in p0) for the BOOTSEL USB drive.
• 0x0003 : REBOOT_TYPE_RAM_IMAGE - reboot into an image in RAM. The region of RAM or XIP RAM is searched for an

image to run. This is the type of reboot used when a RAM UF2 is dragged onto the BOOTSEL USB drive.

◦p0 - the region start address (word-aligned).

◦p1 - the region size (word-aligned).
• 0x0004 : REBOOT_TYPE_FLASH_UPDATE - variant of REBOOT_TYPE_NORMAL to use when flash has been updated. This is the type

of reboot used after dragging a flash UF2 onto the BOOTSEL USB drive.

◦p0 - the address of the start of the region of flash that was updated. If this address matches the start address

of a partition or slot, then that partition or slot is treated preferentially during boot (when there is a choice).

This type of boot facilitates TBYB (Section 5.1.17) and version downgrades.
• 0x000d : REBOOT_TYPE_PC_SP - reboot to a specific PC and SP. Note: this is not allowed in the Arm-NS variant.

◦p0 - the initial program counter (PC) to start executing at. This must have the lowest bit set for Arm and clear

for RISC-V

◦p1 - the initial stack pointer (SP).

All of the above, can have optional flags ORed in:

• 0x0010 : REBOOT_TO_ARM - switch both cores to the Arm architecture (rather than leaving them as is). The call will fail

with BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_STATE if the Arm architecture is not supported.
• 0x0020 : REBOOT_TO_RISCV - switch both cores to the RISC-V architecture (rather than leaving them as is). The call will

fail with BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_STATE if the RISC-V architecture is not supported.

5.4. Bootrom APIs

RP2350 Datasheet

• 0x0100 : NO_RETURN_ON_SUCCESS - the watchdog hardware is asynchronous. Setting this bit forces this method not to

return if the reboot is successfully initiated.

NOTE

The p0 and p1 parameters are generally written to watchdog scratch registers 2 & 3, and are interpreted post-reboot

by the boot path code. The exception is REBOOT_TYPE_NORMAL where this API handles the p0 value before rebooting; the

boot path itself does not accept any parameters for REBOOT_TYPE_NORMAL.

5.4.8.25. secure_call

Code: 'S','C'

Signature: int secure_call(…)

Supported architectures: Arm-NS

Returns: >= 0 on success, a negative error code on error.

Call a Secure method from Non-secure code, passing the method to be called in the register r4 (other arguments

passed as normal).

This method provides the ability to decouple the Non-secure code from the Secure code, allowing the former to call

methods in the latter without needing to know the location of the methods.

This call will always return BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_STATE unless Secure Arm code has provided a handler function via

set_rom_callback(); if there is a handler function, this method will return the return code that the handler returns, with

the convention that BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_ARG if the "function selector" (in r4) is not supported.

Certain well-known "function selectors" will be pre-defined to facilitate interaction between Secure and Non-secure SDK

code, or indeed with other environments (for example, logging to secure UART/USB CDC, launch of core 1 from NS

code, watchdog reboot from NS code back into NS code, etc.)

To avoid conflicts the following bit patterns are used for "function selectors":

• 0b0xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx is a "well known" function selector; don’t use for your own methods
• 0b10xx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx is a "unique" function selector intended to be unlikely to clash with

others'. The lower 30 bits should be chosen at random
• 0b11xx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx is a "private" function selector intended for use by tightly coupled NS and

S code

5.4.8.26. set_bootrom_stack

Code: 'S','S'

Signature: int set_bootrom_stack(uint32_t base_size[2])

Supported architectures: RISC-V

Returns: BOOTROM_OK (0) on success, a negative error code on error.

Most bootrom functions are written just once, in Arm code, to save space. As a result these functions are emulated

when running under the RISC-V architecture. This is largely transparent to the user, however the stack used by the Arm

emulation is separate from the calling user’s stack, and is stored in boot RAM and is of quite limited size. When using

certain of the more complex APIs or if nesting bootrom calls from within IRQs, you may need to provide a larger stack.

This method allows the caller to specify a region of RAM to use as the stack for the current core by passing a pointer to

two values: the word aligned base address, and the size in bytes (multiple of 4).

The method fills in the previous base/size values into the passed array before returning.

5.4.8.27. set_ns_api_permission

Code: 'S','P'

Signature: int set_ns_api_permission(uint ns_api_num, bool allowed)

Supported architectures: Arm-S

Returns: BOOTROM_OK (0) on success, a negative error code on error.

Allow or disallow the specific NS API; all NS APIs default to disabled.

ns_api_num is one of the following, configuring Arm-NS access to the given API. When an NS API is disabled, calling it will

return BOOTROM_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED.

• 0x0: get_sys_info
• 0x1: flash_op
• 0x2: flash_runtime_to_storage_addr
• 0x3: get_partition_table_info
• 0x4: secure_call
• 0x5: otp_access
• 0x6: reboot
• 0x7: get_b_partition

NOTE

All permissions default to disallowed after a reset (see also bootrom_state_reset()).

5.4.8.28. set_rom_callback

Code: 'R','C'

Signature: int set_rom_callback(uint callback_number, int (*callback)(…))

Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V

Returns: >= 0 (the old callback pointer) on success, a negative error code on error.

The only currently supported callback_number is 0 which sets the callback used for the secure_call API.

A callback pointer of 0 deletes the callback function, a positive callback pointer (all valid function pointers are on

RP2350) sets the callback function, but a negative callback pointer can be passed to get the old value without setting a

new value.

If successful, returns >=0 (the existing value of the function pointer on entry to the function).

5.4.8.29. validate_ns_buffer

Code: 'V','B'

Signature: void *validate_ns_buffer(const void *addr, uint32_t size, uint32_t write, uint32_t *ok)

Supported architectures: Arm-S

Returns: addr on success, or a negative error code on error. On RP2350 A3 and newer there are additional out-of-band

return values, detailed below.

Utility method that can be used by Secure Arm code to validate a buffer passed to it from Non-secure code.
