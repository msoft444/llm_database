6.5. Power reduction strategies

RP2350 retains the SLEEP and DORMANT states for dynamic power control from RP2040. It extends these states by

introducing power domains (Section 6.2.1), which allow power to be removed from various components on chip,

virtually eliminating the leakage currents, and allowing lower power modes to be supported.
