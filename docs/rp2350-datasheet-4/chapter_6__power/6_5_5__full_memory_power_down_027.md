# 6.5.5. Full memory power down

6.5.5. Full memory power down

RP2350 can completely power down its internal SRAM. Unlike the memory periphery power down described in Section

6.5.4, this completely disconnects the SRAM from the power supply, reducing static power to near zero.

Contents are lost when fully powering down memories. When you power memories up again following a power down,
