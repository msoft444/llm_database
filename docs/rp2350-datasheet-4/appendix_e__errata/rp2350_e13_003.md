# RP2350-E13

| Reference | RP2350-E13 |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | A binary containing an explicitly invalid IMAGE DEF followed by a valid IMAGE DEF (in that order) fails to boot _ _ |
| Affects | RP2350 A2 |
| Description | When the block loop of a binary contains an IMAGE DEF that is explicitly invalid before the valid IMAGE DEF for _ _ RP2350, booting from that binary fails. An IMAGE DEF is explicitly invalid if either: _ • It is for RP2040 • It doesn’t have a rollback version, and the BOOT_FLAGS0.ROLLBACK_REQUIRED flag is set in OTP |
| Workaround | Instead of an explicitly invalid IMAGE DEF, use an IGNORED item. RP2040 doesn’t require an IMAGE DEF to boot a _ _ binary, and when using rollback, the invalid IMAGE DEF is ignored anyway. _ SDK uses this workaround for RP2040 binaries. When you set PICO CRT0 INCLUDE PICOBIN BLOCK, the SDK _ _ _ _ uses an IGNORED item instead of an IMAGE DEF for RP2040 binaries. You can override this behaviour and use _ an IMAGE DEF by setting PICO CRT0 INCLUDE PICOBIN IMAGE TYPE ITEM. For an additional example, see the _ _ _ _ _ _ _ universal binaries in pico-examples. picotool uses this workaround for rollback versions. When you use picotool seal to seal a binary and add a rollback version, it converts the first IMAGE DEF without a rollback version to an IGNORED item. _ |
