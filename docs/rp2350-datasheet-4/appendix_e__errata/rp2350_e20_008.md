RP2350-E20

| Reference | RP2350-E20 |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | An attacker with physical access to the chip and the ability to physically "glitch" the CPU at precise times, could cause unsigned code execution on a secured RP2350 by targeting legitimate Non-secure calls to the bootrom reboot() function |
| Affects | RP2350 A2 |
| Description | The RP2350 bootrom provides a reboot() function to reboot the RP2350. This method is potentially accessible to Non-secure callers via the PICOBOOT interface (e.g. picotool) or, if the corresponding permission is set, to Non-secure code running on the device. A particular reboot type (REBOOT TYPE PC SP) isn’t allowed in the bootrom reboot() function when called _ _ _ from Non-secure code as it launches user-provided code in a Secure state post reboot. The reboot() function correctly disallows this reboot type when called from a Non-secure context. However, if a valid reboot type (e.g. REBOOT TYPE NORMAL) is passed to the function instead, a late, precisely-timed processor _ _ glitch can cause an incorrect code path to be taken, which configures the WATCHDOG scratch registers in a way that allows secure execution of user-provided code post reboot. |
