# RP2350-E19

![Page 1361 figure](images/fig_p1361.png)

| Reference | RP2350-E19 |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | RP2350 reboot hangs if certain bits are set in FRCE_OFF when rebooting. |
| Affects | RP2350 A2 |
| Description | An incorrect assertion in the boot path, assumes the all bits (other than FRCE_OFF.PROC1) are clear. These bits can only be set during boot if the user had set them and then re-entered the boot path. |
| Workaround | Don’t perform a WATCHDOG or POWMAN boot, or a core0 reset with bits other than FRCE_OFF.PROC1 set. |
| Fixed by | RP2350 A3 bootrom, Documentation |
