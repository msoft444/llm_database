# 8.2.3. Usage

8.2.3. Usage

The XOSC is disabled on chip startup and RP2350 boots using the Ring Oscillator (ROSC). To start the XOSC, the

programmer must set the CTRL_ENABLE register. The XOSC is not immediately usable because it takes time for the

oscillations to build to sufficient amplitude. This time will be dependent on the chosen crystal but will be of the order of

a few milliseconds. The XOSC incorporates a timer controlled by the STARTUP_DELAY register to automatically manage this,

which sets a flag (STATUS_STABLE) when the XOSC clock is usable.
