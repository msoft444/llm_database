# 11.2.6. Pin mapping

11.2.6. Pin mapping

PIO controls the output level and direction of up to 32 GPIOs, and can observe their input levels. On every system clock

cycle, each state machine may do none, one, or both of the following:

• Change the level or direction of some GPIOs via an OUT or SET instruction, or read some GPIOs via an IN instruction
• Change the level or direction of some GPIOs via a side-set operation

Each of these operations uses one of four contiguous ranges of GPIOs, with the base and count of each range

configured via each state machine’s PINCTRL register. There is a range for each of OUT, SET, IN and side-set operations.

Each range can cover any of the GPIOs accessible to a given PIO block (on RP2350 this is the 30 user GPIOs), and the

ranges can overlap.

For each individual GPIO output (level and direction separately), PIO considers all 8 writes that may have occurred on

that cycle, and applies the write from the highest-numbered state machine. If the same state machine performs a SET

/OUT and a side-set on the same GPIO simultaneously, the side-set is used. If no state machine writes to this GPIO

output, its value does not change from the previous cycle.

Generally each state machine’s outputs are mapped to a distinct group of GPIOs, implementing some peripheral

interface.
