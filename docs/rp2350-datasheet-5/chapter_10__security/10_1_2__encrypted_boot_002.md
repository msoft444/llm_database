# 10.1.2. Encrypted boot

10.1.2. Encrypted boot

RP2350 contains 8 kB of OTP, which can be protected at 128-byte page granularity. This protection comes in the

following forms:

• hard locks, which permanently revoke read or write access by Secure or Non-secure code
• soft locks, which revoke permissions only until the next reset of the OTP block.

Encrypted boot stores decryption keys in OTP, and protects the keys from later boot stages using soft locks.

RP2350 supports loading encrypted binaries from external flash into SRAM, which can then decrypt their own contents

in-place. Many implementations are possible, but as a concrete example, this section describes the flash-resident binary

encryption support provided by the SDK and picotool.

1. First, the developer should process a plain SRAM binary into an encrypted binary. To encrypt your binary, the SDK

completes the following steps after a build:

a. Sign the payload binary using the boot private key, if you didn’t already do this during the build.

b. Encrypt the payload binary using the encryption key (not the private key).

c. Append a small decryption stage to the binary that contains a modified copy of the payload’s IMAGE_DEF (the

original is unreadable, as it is encrypted).

d. Sign the decryption stage together with the encrypted contents, using the boot private key.

encrypted binary, the bootrom completes the following steps:

1. Loads the entire encrypted binary into SRAM.

2. Verifies the signature of the decryption stage, then jumps into the decryption stage, comprised of the following

steps:

a. Reads the decryption key stored in OTP (this stage may soft-lock that OTP page until next boot).

b. Decrypts the encrypted binary payload using the decryption key.

c. Calls the chain_image() bootrom API (Section 5.4.8.2) on the decrypted region of SRAM.

3. Verifies the decrypted binary payload in the same manner as it verified the decryption stage, then jumps into the

binary.

The decryption stage is not itself encrypted, but it is signed. Storing the decryption stage in the clear does not present

additional risk because the source code for the decryption stage is open source and highly scrutinised. Without the

decryption key, the encrypted payload cannot be read. Because the key only exists on-device, static analysis of the

encrypted binary cannot recover it.

Resetting the OTP to reopen soft locks also resets the processors. Upon reset, the processors re-run the decryption

stage and re-lock the page with the decryption key. The BOOTDIS register allows the bootrom to detect OTP resets and

disable the watchdog and POWMAN boot vectors. This ensures that the decryption stage is not skipped and the key

remains protected.

NOTE

The decryption stage is deliberately not included in the bootrom, so that it can be updated. The bootrom handles

only public key cryptography, so there is no concern of power analysis attacks, but this reasoning does not apply to

the decryption stage. Power analysis mitigations require iteration as techniques improve.

This scheme supports designs where the decryption key is accessible only to the decryption stage. When the decryption

key is also required at runtime to read additional encrypted flash contents on-demand, processor security features and

OTP page locks can restrict key access to a small subset of trusted code, such as a TF-M Secure Storage service.

In addition to software mitigations provided by the decryption stage, RP2350 supports randomising the frequency

controls of its internal ring oscillator (Section 8.3) to make it more difficult to recover the system clock from power

traces.

Encrypted execute-in-place is not supported in hardware, but the spare 32 MB cached XIP window (Section 4.4.1) can

provide software-defined execute-in-place by trapping cache misses and pinning at the miss address. This may be used

to transparently decrypt data on-demand from external flash.
