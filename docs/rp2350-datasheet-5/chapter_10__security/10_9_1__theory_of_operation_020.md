10.9.1. Theory of operation

The glitch detector is comprised of four identical detector circuits, based on a pair of D flip-flops. These detector

circuits are each placed in different, physically distant locations within the core voltage domain.

detector trigger

circuit. Two flops each

toggle on every

system clock cycle.

One has a

programmable delay

line in its feedback

path, the other does

not. Loss of setup or

hold margin causes

one of the flops to fail

to toggle, so the flops

values differ, setting

the trigger output.

The detector triggers when the two D-flops take on different values, which is impossible under normal circumstances.

The delay line is programmable from 75% to 120% of the minimum system clock period in increments of 15%. Higher

delays make the circuit more sensitive to loss of setup margin. To configure initial sensitivity, use the

GLITCH_DETECTOR_SENS OTP flags. You can fine-tune sensitivity for each detector using the SENSITIVITY register.

Because the circuit is constructed from digital standard cells, it closely tracks the changes in propagation delay to

nearby cells caused by voltage and temperature fluctuations. Therefore the delay line’s propagation delay is specified

as a fraction of the maximum system clock data path delay, rather than a fixed time in nanoseconds.
