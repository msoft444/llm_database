# 6.1.4. USB PHY and OTP supply (USB_OTP_VDD)

6.1.4. USB PHY and OTP supply (USB_OTP_VDD)

USB_OTP_VDD supplies the chip’s USB PHY and OTP memory, and should be powered at a nominal 3.3 V. To reduce the

number of external power supplies, USB_OTP_VDD can use the same power source as the core voltage regulator analogue

supply (VREG_AVDD), or digital IO supply (IOVDD), assuming IOVDD is also powered at 3.3 V. This supply must always be

provided, even in applications where the USB PHY is never used.

USB_OTP_VDD should be decoupled with a 100nF capacitor close to the chip’s USB_OTP_VDD pin.
