| Summary | Inadequate synchronisation of USB status signals |
| Affects | RP2350 A2, RP2350 A3, RP2350 A4 (mitigated on A3) |
| Description | Within the USB peripheral, certain Host and Device controller events cross from clk usb to clk sys. Many _ _ of these signals don’t have appropriate synchronisation methods to ensure that they are correctly registered when clk sys is equal to or slower than clk usb. _ _ The following signals lack appropriate synchronisation methods: SIE STATUS: _ • TRANS COMPLETE _ • SETUP REC _ • STALL REC _ • NAK REC _ • RX SHORT PACKET _ _ • ACK REQ _ • DATA SEQ ERROR _ _ • RX OVERFLOW _ INTR: • HOST SOF _ • ERROR CRC _ • ERROR BIT STUFF _ _ • ERROR RX OVERFLOW _ _ • ERROR RX TIMEOUT _ _ • ERROR DATA SEQ _ _ The bootrom’s USB bootloader derives clk sys from pll usb. Therefore, the two clock frequencies are _ _ identical and have a fixed phase relationship. Under this condition, and at extremes of PVT, lab testing has shown that these events can be lost, which results in unreliable USB bootloader behaviour. RP2350 A3 incorporates hardware fixes that improve timing margins on signals critical to the bootrom, ensuring reliable operation across PVT. However, software must not rely on these fixes, and so they aren’t elaborated on. |
| Workaround | Run clk sys faster than clk usb by at least 10% when the peripheral is in use. Signalling of quasi-static bus _ _ states such as reset, suspend, and resume aren’t affected by this erratum, so clk sys can be lower in _ these cases. |
