RP2350-E21

| Reference | RP2350-E21 |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | An attacker with physical access to the chip, and the ability to physically "glitch" the CPU at precise times, could potentially extract sensitive data from OTP on a RP2350 in BOOTSEL mode. |
| Affects | RP2350 A2 |
| Description | An attacker with physical access to the chip, could precisely time physical glitch attacks during entry to BOOTSEL mode and cause some OTP page access permissions for BOOTSEL mode not to be applied, leading to possible exposure of sensitive data. The RP2350 BOOTSEL mode exposes an API over PICOBOOT such that a user can read or write OTP rows through picotool. Certain OTP rows (such as encryption keys or other secrets) shouldn’t be readable through this method. Equally, certain rows might be protected against writes. This is handled at the page (64 row) level by page locks stored in OTP. On entry to BOOTSEL mode, the OTP should be locked down such that no software (including Secure software) can access anything not marked as accessible to BOOTSEL mode. However, with two precisely timed processor glitches, it’s possible to prevent a page being correctly locked. |
| Workaround | 1. Disable the BOOTSEL mode bootloader altogether via BOOT_FLAGS0.DISABLE_BOOTSEL_UART_BOOT, BOOT_FLAGS0.DISABLE_BOOTSEL_USB_PICOBOOT_IFC, and BOOT_FLAGS0.DISABLE_BOOTSEL_USB_MSD_IFC. BOOT_FLAGS0.DISABLE_BOOTSEL_USB_PICOBOOT_IFC is the most important, as PICOBOOT provides the conduit for a user to access the OTP, however any other use of BOOTSEL mode could be vulnerable in conjunction with some other future attack on the non-Secure code. 1. Use an OTP access key (Section 13.5.2) to protect OTP data you don’t want accessed from BOOTSEL mode, although this only helps if the data isn’t needed until your application can provide the key. |
