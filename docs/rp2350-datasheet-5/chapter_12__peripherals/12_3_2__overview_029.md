# 12.3.2. Overview

12.3.2. Overview

The PrimeCell SSP is a master or slave interface for synchronous serial communication with peripheral devices that

have Motorola SPI, National Semiconductor Microwire, or Texas Instruments synchronous serial interfaces.

The PrimeCell SSP performs serial-to-parallel conversion on data received from a peripheral device. The CPU accesses

data, control, and status information through the AMBA APB interface. The transmit and receive paths are buffered with

internal FIFO memories, enabling up to eight 16-bit values to be stored independently in both transmit and receive

modes. Serial data transmits on SSPTXD and is received on SSPRXD.

The PrimeCell SSP includes a programmable bit rate clock divider and prescaler to generate the serial output clock,

SSPCLKOUT, from the input clock, SSPCLK. Bit rates are supported to 2MHz and higher, subject to choice of frequency for

SSPCLK, and the maximum bit rate is determined by peripheral devices.

You can use the control registers SSPCR0 and SSPCR1 to program the PrimeCell SSP operating mode, frame format, and

size.

The following individually maskable interrupts are generated:

• SSPTXINTR requests servicing of the transmit buffer
• SSPRXINTR requests servicing of the receive buffer
• SSPRORINTR indicates an overrun condition in the receive FIFO
• SSPRTINTR indicates that a timeout period expired while data was present in the receive FIFO.

A single combined interrupt is asserted if any of the individual interrupts are asserted and unmasked. This interrupt is

connected to the processor interrupt controllers in RP2350.

In addition to the above interrupts, a set of DMA signals are provided for interfacing with a DMA controller.

Depending on the operating mode selected, the SSPFSSOUT output operates as:

• an active-HIGH frame synchronization output for Texas Instruments synchronous serial frame format
• an active-LOW slave select for SPI and Microwire.
