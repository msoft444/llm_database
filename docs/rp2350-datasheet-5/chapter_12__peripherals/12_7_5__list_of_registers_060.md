| 0x040 | MAIN_CTRL | Main control register |
| 0x044 | SOF_WR | Set the SOF (Start of Frame) frame number in the host controller. The SOF packet is sent every 1ms and the host will increment the frame number by 1 each time. |

| 0x04c | SIE_CTRL | SIE control register |
| 0x050 | SIE_STATUS | SIE status register |
| 0x054 | INT_EP_CTRL | interrupt endpoint control register |
| 0x058 | BUFF_STATUS | Buffer status register. A bit set here indicates that a buffer has completed on the endpoint (if the buffer interrupt is enabled). It is possible for 2 buffers to be completed, so clearing the buffer status bit may instantly re set it on the next clock cycle. |
| 0x05c | BUFF_CPU_SHOULD_HANDLE | Which of the double buffers should be handled. Only valid if using an interrupt per buffer (i.e. not per 2 buffers). Not valid for host interrupt endpoint polling because they are only single buffered. |
| 0x060 | EP_ABORT | Device only: Can be set to ignore the buffer control register for this endpoint in case you would like to revoke a buffer. A NAK will be sent for every access to the endpoint until this bit is cleared. A corresponding bit in EP ABORT DONE is set when it is safe _ _ to modify the buffer control register. |
| 0x064 | EP_ABORT_DONE | Device only: Used in conjunction with EP ABORT. Set once an _ endpoint is idle so the programmer knows it is safe to modify the buffer control register. |
| 0x068 | EP_STALL_ARM | Device: this bit must be set in conjunction with the STALL bit in the buffer control register to send a STALL on EP0. The device controller clears these bits when a SETUP packet is received because the USB spec requires that a STALL condition is cleared when a SETUP packet is received. |
| 0x06c | NAK_POLL | Used by the host controller. Sets the wait time in microseconds before trying again if the device replies with a NAK. |
| 0x070 | EP_STATUS_STALL_NAK | Device: bits are set when the IRQ ON NAK or IRQ ON STALL bits are _ _ _ _ set. For EP0 this comes from SIE CTRL. For all other endpoints it _ comes from the endpoint control register. |
| 0x074 | USB_MUXING | Where to connect the USB controller. Should be to_phy by default. |
| 0x078 | USB_PWR | Overrides for the power signals in the event that the VBUS signals are not hooked up to GPIO. Set the value of the override and then the override enable to switch over to the override value. |
| 0x07c | USBPHY_DIRECT | This register allows for direct control of the USB phy. Use in conjunction with usbphy_direct_override register to enable each override bit. |
| 0x080 | USBPHY_DIRECT_OVERRIDE | Override enable for each control in usbphy_direct |
| 0x084 | USBPHY_TRIM | Used to adjust trim values of USB phy pull down resistors. |
| 0x088 | LINESTATE_TUNING | Used for debug only. |
| 0x08c | INTR | Raw Interrupts |
| 0x090 | INTE | Interrupt Enable |

| 0x098 | INTS | Interrupt status after masking & forcing |
| 0x100 | SOF_TIMESTAMP_RAW | Device only. Raw value of free-running PHY clock counter @48MHz. Used to calculate time between SOF events. |
| 0x104 | SOF_TIMESTAMP_LAST | Device only. Value of free-running PHY clock counter @48MHz when last SOF event occured. |
| 0x108 | SM_STATE |  |
| 0x10c | EP_TX_ERROR | TX error count for each endpoint. Write to each field to reset the counter to 0. |
| 0x110 | EP_RX_ERROR | RX error count for each endpoint. Write to each field to reset the counter to 0. |
| 0x114 | DEV_SM_WATCHDOG | Watchdog that forces the device state machine to idle and raises an interrupt if the device stays in a state that isn’t idle for the configured limit. The counter is reset on every state transition. Set limit while enable is low and then set the enable. |
