# 3.5.3. RISC-V debug

3.5.3. RISC-V debug

There is a single APB Mem-AP, at offset 0x0a000 in the debug address space, which provides access only to the RISC-V

Debug Module (DM). The DM is a standard component which the debugger uses to enumerate RISC-V harts present in

the system, debug software running on each hart, and access the system bus. It is defined in the RISC-V debug

specification, of which RP2350 implements version 0.13.2.

From the point of view of the RISC-V debug specification, the SW-DP and APB Mem-AP function jointly as the Debug

Transport Module for this system. The DM is located at offset 0x0 in the APB-AP’s downstream address space, and the

registers are word-sized and byte-addressed, meaning the DM register addresses in the debug specification must be

multiplied by 4 to get the correct APB address.

On RP2350, each core possesses exactly one hardware thread (hart). Core 0 has a hart ID of 0, and core 1 has a hart ID

of 1. These hart IDs match the hart index used in the DM. This DM is also equipped with the hart array mask select

extension, which allows multiple cores to be reset/halted/resumed simultaneously.

The DM is equipped with the System Bus Access (SBA) extension, which allows the debugger to access the system bus

without halting either core. This can be used for minimally intrusive debug techniques like Segger RTT. SBA accesses

arbitrate with core 1’s load/store port to access the system bus, but they are treated as distinct from core 1’s accesses

for the purpose of bus filtering (Section 10.6.2), which means it is possible to lock software out of a peripheral whilst

retaining debug access. Processor load/stores in Debug mode are also treated as debug accesses for the purpose of

bus filtering.

The DM is able to reset each core individually using the dmcontrol.hartreset control. This resets only the selected

processor. The dmcontrol.ndmreset resets both processors only, which is the minimum requirement in the RISC-V debug

specification. A full system reset, which includes the DM, can be performed using the SYSRESETREQ control in the SW-

DP, a switched core domain reset configured in POWMAN and initiated by the watchdog, or any full-system reset such

as the RUN pin. A PSM reset initiated by the watchdog can reset almost all system-level hardware except for the DM,

but note that the DM becomes momentarily inaccessible whilst the system clock’s clock generator is reset, which is the

reason for dmcontrol.ndmreset resetting the processors only.

For details on the processor side of RISC-V debug, see Section 3.8.5. See also the Hazard3 source code at

github.com/Wren6991/Hazard3, which includes the DM implementation under the hdl/debug/dm/ directory.
