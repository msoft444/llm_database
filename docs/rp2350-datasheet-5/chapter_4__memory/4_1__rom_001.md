# 4.1. ROM

4.1. ROM

A 32 kB read-only memory (ROM) appears at address 0x00000000. The ROM contents are fixed permanently at the time

the silicon is manufactured. Chapter 5 describes the ROM contents in detail, but in summary it contains:

• Core 0 Boot code (Section 5.2)
• Core 1 Launch code (Section 5.3)
• Runtime APIs (Section 5.4).
• USB bootloader

◦Mass storage interface for drag and drop of UF2 flash and SRAM binaries (Section 5.5)

◦PICOBOOT interface to support picotool and advanced operations like OTP programming (Section 5.6)

◦Support for white-labelling all USB exposed information/identifiers (Section 5.7)
• UART bootloader: minimal shell to load an SRAM binary from a host microcontroller (Section 5.8)

The ROM offers single-cycle access, and has a dedicated AHB5 arbiter, so it can be accessed simultaneously with other

memory devices. Writing to the ROM has no effect, and no bus fault is generated on write.

The ROM is covered by IDAU regions enumerated in Section 10.2.2. These aid in partitioning the bootrom between

Secure and Non-secure code: in particular the USB/UART bootloader runs as a Non-secure client application on Arm, to

reduce the attack surface of the secure boot implementation.

Certain ROM features are not implemented on RISC-V, most notably secure boot.
