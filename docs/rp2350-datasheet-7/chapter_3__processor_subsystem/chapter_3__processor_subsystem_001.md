processor subsystem

connects two

processors to the

system bus, peripheral

interrupts, GPIOs, and

a Serial Wire Debug

(SWD) connection

from an external

debug host. It also

contains closely-

coupled peripherals,

and peripherals used

for synchronisation

and communication,

which are collectively

referred to as the

single-cycle IO

RP2350 is a symmetric dual-core system. Two cores operate simultaneously and independently, offering high

processing throughput and the ability to route interrupts to different cores to improve throughput and latency of

interrupt handling. The two cores have a symmetric view of the system bus; all memory resources on RP2350 are

accessible equally on both cores, with the same performance.

Each core has a pair of 32-bit AHB5 links to the system bus. One is used exclusively for instruction fetch, the other

exclusively for load or store instructions and debugger access. Each core can perform one instruction fetch and one

load or store access per cycle, provided there are no conflicts on the downstream bus ports.

There are two sockets for cores to attach to the system bus, referred to as core 0 and core 1 throughout this datasheet.

(They may synonymously be referred to as core0, core1, proc0 and proc1 in register documentation.) The processor

plugged into each socket is selectable at boot time:

• A Cortex-M33 processor, implementing the Armv8-M Main instruction set, plus extensions
• A Hazard3 processor, implementing the RV32IMAC instruction set, plus extensions

Cortex-M33 is the default option. Whichever processor is unused is held in reset with its clock gated at the top level.

Unused processors use zero dynamic power. See Section 3.9 for information about the architecture selection hardware.

The two Cortex-M33 instances are identical. They are configured with the Security, DSP and FPU extensions, as well as

8× SAU regions, 8× Secure MPU regions and 8× Non-secure MPU regions. Section 3.7 documents the Cortex-M33

processor as well as the specific configuration used on RP2350. The two Hazard3 instances are also identical to one

another; see Section 3.8 for the features and operation of the Hazard3 processors.

The Cortex-M33 implementation of the Armv8-M Security extension (also known as TrustZone-M) isolates trusted and

untrusted software running on-device. RP2350 extends the strict partitioning of the Arm Secure and Non-secure states

throughout the system, including the ability to assign peripherals, GPIOs and DMA channels to each security domain.

See Section 10.2 for a high-level overview of Armv8-M Security extension features in the context of the RP2350 security

architecture.

Not shown on Figure 6 are the coprocessors for the Cortex-M33. These are closely coupled to the core, offering a

transfer rate of 64 bits per cycle in and out of the Arm register file. You may consider them to be inside the Cortex-M33

block on the diagram. RP2350 equips each Cortex-M33 with the following coprocessors:

• Coprocessor 0: GPIO coprocessor (GPIOC), described in Section 3.6.1
• Coprocessors 4 and 5: Secure and Non-secure instances of the double-precision coprocessor (DCP), described in

Section 3.6.2
• Coprocessor 7: redundancy coprocessor (RCP), described in Section 3.6.3

An external debug host can access both cores over a Serial Wire Debug (SWD) bus. The host can:

• run, halt and reset the cores
• inspect internal core state such as registers
• access memory from the core’s point of view
• load code onto the device and run it

Section 3.5 describes the debug hardware in addition to the instruction trace hardware available on the Arm processors.

Peripherals throughout the system assert interrupt requests (IRQs) to demand attention from the processors. For

example, a UART peripheral asserts its interrupt when it has received a character, so the processor can collect it from

the receive FIFO. All interrupts route to both cores, and the core’s internal interrupt controller selects the interrupt

signals it wishes to subscribe to. Section 3.2 defines the system-level IRQ numbering as well as details of the Arm non-

maskable interrupt (NMI).

The event signals described in Section 3.3 are a mechanism for processors to sleep when waiting for other processors

in the system to complete a task or free up some resource. Each processor sees events emitted by the other processor.

They also see exclusivity events generated by the Global Exclusive Monitor described in Section 2.1.6, which is the piece

of hardware that allows the processors to safely manipulate shared variables using atomic read-modify-write

sequences.
