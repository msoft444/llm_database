3.1.11. List of registers

The SIO registers start at a base address of 0xd0000000 (defined as SIO_BASE in SDK).

| Offset | Name | Info |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x000 | CPUID | Processor core identifier |
| 0x004 | GPIO_IN | Input value for GPIO0…31. In the Non-secure SIO, Secure-only GPIOs (as per ACCESSCTRL) appear as zero. |
| 0x008 | GPIO_HI_IN | Input value on GPIO32…47, QSPI IOs and USB pins In the Non-secure SIO, Secure-only GPIOs (as per ACCESSCTRL) appear as zero. |
| 0x010 | GPIO_OUT | GPIO0…31 output value |
| 0x014 | GPIO_HI_OUT | Output value for GPIO32…47, QSPI IOs and USB pins. Write to set output level (1/0 → high/low). Reading back gives the last value written, NOT the input value from the pins. If core 0 and core 1 both write to GPIO_HI_OUT simultaneously (or to a SET/CLR/XOR alias), the result is as though the write from core 0 took place first, and the write from core 1 was then applied to that intermediate result. In the Non-secure SIO, Secure-only GPIOs (as per ACCESSCTRL) ignore writes, and their output status reads back as zero. This is also true for SET/CLR/XOR aliases of this register. |

If core 0 and core 1 both write to GPIO_HI_OE simultaneously (or to a SET/CLR/XOR alias), the result is as though the write from core 0 took place first, and the write from core 1 was then applied to that intermediate result. In the Non-secure SIO, Secure-only GPIOs (as per ACCESSCTRL) ignore writes, and their output status reads back as zero. This is also true for SET/CLR/XOR aliases of this register. |

| 0x178 | SPINLOCK30 | Spinlock register 30 |
| 0x17c | SPINLOCK31 | Spinlock register 31 |
| 0x180 | DOORBELL_OUT_SET | Trigger a doorbell interrupt on the opposite core. Write 1 to a bit to set the corresponding bit in DOORBELL_IN on the opposite core. This raises the opposite core’s doorbell interrupt. Read to get the status of the doorbells currently asserted on the opposite core. This is equivalent to that core reading its own DOORBELL_IN status. |
| 0x184 | DOORBELL_OUT_CLR | Clear doorbells which have been posted to the opposite core. This register is intended for debugging and initialisation purposes. Writing 1 to a bit in DOORBELL_OUT_CLR clears the corresponding bit in DOORBELL_IN on the opposite core. Clearing all bits will cause that core’s doorbell interrupt to deassert. Since the usual order of events is for software to send events using DOORBELL_OUT_SET, and acknowledge incoming events by writing to DOORBELL_IN_CLR, this register should be used with caution to avoid race conditions. Reading returns the status of the doorbells currently asserted on the other core, i.e. is equivalent to that core reading its own DOORBELL_IN status. |
| 0x188 | DOORBELL_IN_SET | Write 1s to trigger doorbell interrupts on this core. Read to get status of doorbells currently asserted on this core. |
| 0x18c | DOORBELL_IN_CLR | Check and acknowledge doorbells posted to this core. This core’s doorbell interrupt is asserted when any bit in this register is 1. Write 1 to each bit to clear that bit. The doorbell interrupt deasserts once all bits are cleared. Read to get status of doorbells currently asserted on this core. |
| 0x190 | PERI_NONSEC | Detach certain core-local peripherals from Secure SIO, and attach them to Non-secure SIO, so that Non-secure software can use them. Attempting to access one of these peripherals from the Secure SIO when it is attached to the Non-secure SIO, or vice versa, will generate a bus error. This register is per-core, and is only present on the Secure SIO. Most SIO hardware is duplicated across the Secure and Non- secure SIO, so is not listed in this register. |
| 0x1a0 | RISCV_SOFTIRQ | Control the assertion of the standard software interrupt (MIP.MSIP) on the RISC-V cores. Unlike the RISC-V timer, this interrupt is not routed to a normal system-level interrupt line, so can not be used by the Arm cores. It is safe for both cores to write to this register on the same cycle. The set/clear effect is accumulated across both cores, and then applied. If a flag is both set and cleared on the same cycle, only the set takes effect. |
| 0x1a4 | MTIME_CTRL | Control register for the RISC-V 64-bit Machine-mode timer. This timer is only present in the Secure SIO, so is only accessible to an Arm core in Secure mode or a RISC-V core in Machine mode. Note whilst this timer follows the RISC-V privileged specification, it is equally usable by the Arm cores. The interrupts are routed to normal system-level interrupt lines as well as to the MIP.MTIP inputs on the RISC-V cores. |
| 0x1b0 | MTIME | Read/write access to the high half of RISC-V Machine-mode timer. This register is shared between both cores. If both cores write on the same cycle, core 1 takes precedence. |
| 0x1b4 | MTIMEH | Read/write access to the high half of RISC-V Machine-mode timer. This register is shared between both cores. If both cores write on the same cycle, core 1 takes precedence. |
| 0x1b8 | MTIMECMP | Low half of RISC-V Machine-mode timer comparator. This register is core-local, i.e., each core gets a copy of this register, with the comparison result routed to its own interrupt line. The timer interrupt is asserted whenever MTIME is greater than or equal to MTIMECMP. This comparison is unsigned, and performed on the full 64-bit values. |
| 0x1bc | MTIMECMPH | High half of RISC-V Machine-mode timer comparator. This register is core-local. The timer interrupt is asserted whenever MTIME is greater than or equal to MTIMECMP. This comparison is unsigned, and performed on the full 64-bit values. |
| 0x1c0 | TMDS_CTRL | Control register for TMDS encoder. |
| 0x1c4 | TMDS_WDATA | Write-only access to the TMDS colour data register. |
| 0x1c8 | TMDS_PEEK_SINGLE | Get the encoding of one pixel’s worth of colour data, packed into a 32-bit value (3x10-bit symbols). The PEEK alias does not shift the colour register when read, but still advances the running DC balance state of each encoder. This is useful for pixel doubling. |
| 0x1cc | TMDS_POP_SINGLE | Get the encoding of one pixel’s worth of colour data, packed into a 32-bit value. The packing is 5 chunks of 3 lanes times 2 bits (30 bits total). Each chunk contains two bits of a TMDS symbol per lane. This format is intended for shifting out with the HSTX peripheral on RP2350. The POP alias shifts the colour register when read, as well as advancing the running DC balance state of each encoder. |
| 0x1d0 | TMDS_PEEK_DOUBLE_L0 | Get lane 0 of the encoding of two pixels' worth of colour data. Two 10-bit TMDS symbols are packed at the bottom of a 32-bit word. The PEEK alias does not shift the colour register when read, but still advances the lane 0 DC balance state. This is useful if all 3 lanes' worth of encode are to be read at once, rather than processing the entire scanline for one lane before moving to the next lane. |
| 0x1d4 | TMDS_POP_DOUBLE_L0 | Get lane 0 of the encoding of two pixels' worth of colour data. Two 10-bit TMDS symbols are packed at the bottom of a 32-bit word. The POP alias shifts the colour register when read, according to the values of PIX_SHIFT and PIX2_NOSHIFT. |
| 0x1d8 | TMDS_PEEK_DOUBLE_L1 | Get lane 1 of the encoding of two pixels' worth of colour data. Two 10-bit TMDS symbols are packed at the bottom of a 32-bit word. The PEEK alias does not shift the colour register when read, but still advances the lane 1 DC balance state. This is useful if all 3 lanes' worth of encode are to be read at once, rather than processing the entire scanline for one lane before moving to the next lane. |
| 0x1dc | TMDS_POP_DOUBLE_L1 | Get lane 1 of the encoding of two pixels' worth of colour data. Two 10-bit TMDS symbols are packed at the bottom of a 32-bit word. The POP alias shifts the colour register when read, according to the values of PIX_SHIFT and PIX2_NOSHIFT. |
| 0x1e0 | TMDS_PEEK_DOUBLE_L2 | Get lane 2 of the encoding of two pixels' worth of colour data. Two 10-bit TMDS symbols are packed at the bottom of a 32-bit word. The PEEK alias does not shift the colour register when read, but still advances the lane 2 DC balance state. This is useful if all 3 lanes' worth of encode are to be read at once, rather than processing the entire scanline for one lane before moving to the next lane. |
| 0x1e4 | TMDS_POP_DOUBLE_L2 | Get lane 2 of the encoding of two pixels' worth of colour data. Two 10-bit TMDS symbols are packed at the bottom of a 32-bit word. The POP alias shifts the colour register when read, according to the values of PIX_SHIFT and PIX2_NOSHIFT. |

RP2350 Datasheet

SIO: RISCV_SOFTIRQ Register

Offset: 0x1a0

Description

Control the assertion of the standard software interrupt (MIP.MSIP) on the RISC-V cores.

Unlike the RISC-V timer, this interrupt is not routed to a normal system-level interrupt line, so can not be used by the Arm

cores.

It is safe for both cores to write to this register on the same cycle. The set/clear effect is accumulated across both

cores, and then applied. If a flag is both set and cleared on the same cycle, only the set takes effect.

RISCV_SOFTIRQ

Register

SIO: MTIME_CTRL Register

Offset: 0x1a4

Description

Control register for the RISC-V 64-bit Machine-mode timer. This timer is only present in the Secure SIO, so is only

accessible to an Arm core in Secure mode or a RISC-V core in Machine mode.

Note whilst this timer follows the RISC-V privileged specification, it is equally usable by the Arm cores. The interrupts

are routed to normal system-level interrupt lines as well as to the MIP.MTIP inputs on the RISC-V cores.

| 28 | CLEAR_BALANCE: Clear the running DC balance state of the TMDS encoders. This bit should be written once at the beginning of each scanline. | SC | 0x0 |
| 27 | PIX2_NOSHIFT: When encoding two pixels’s worth of symbols in one cycle (a read of a PEEK/POP_DOUBLE register), the second encoder sees a shifted version of the colour data register. This control disables that shift, so that both encoder layers see the same pixel data. This is used for pixel doubling. | RW | 0x0 |
| 26:24 | PIX_SHIFT: Shift applied to the colour data register with each read of a POP alias register. Reading from the POP_SINGLE register, or reading from the POP_DOUBLE register with PIX2_NOSHIFT set (for pixel doubling), shifts by the indicated amount. Reading from a POP_DOUBLE register when PIX2_NOSHIFT is clear will shift by double the indicated amount. (Shift by 32 means no shift.) | RW | 0x0 |
|  | Enumerated values: |  |  |
|  | 0x0 → 0: Do not shift the colour data register. |  |  |
|  | 0x1 → 1: Shift the colour data register by 1 bit |  |  |
|  | 0x2 → 2: Shift the colour data register by 2 bits |  |  |

| 23 | INTERLEAVE: Enable lane interleaving for reads of PEEK_SINGLE/POP_SINGLE. When interleaving is disabled, each of the 3 symbols appears as a contiguous 10-bit field, with lane 0 being the least-significant and starting at bit 0 of the register. When interleaving is enabled, the symbols are packed into 5 chunks of 3 lanes times 2 bits (30 bits total). Each chunk contains two bits of a TMDS symbol per lane, with lane 0 being the least significant. | RW | 0x0 |

| 11:8 | L2_ROT: Right-rotate the 16 LSBs of the colour accumulator by 0-15 bits, in order to get the MSB of the lane 2 (red) colour data aligned with the MSB of the 8-bit encoder input. For example, for RGB565 (red most significant), red is bits 15:11, so should be right-rotated by 8 bits to align with bits 7:3 of the encoder input. | RW | 0x0 |
| 7:4 | L1_ROT: Right-rotate the 16 LSBs of the colour accumulator by 0-15 bits, in order to get the MSB of the lane 1 (green) colour data aligned with the MSB of the 8-bit encoder input. For example, for RGB565, green is bits 10:5, so should be right-rotated by 3 bits to align with bits 7:2 of the encoder input. | RW | 0x0 |
| 3:0 | L0_ROT: Right-rotate the 16 LSBs of the colour accumulator by 0-15 bits, in order to get the MSB of the lane 0 (blue) colour data aligned with the MSB of the 8-bit encoder input. For example, for RGB565 (red most significant), blue is bits 4:0, so should be right-rotated by 13 to align with bits 7:3 of the encoder input. | RW | 0x0 |
