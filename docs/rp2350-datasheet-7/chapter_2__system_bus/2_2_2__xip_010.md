# 2.2.2. XIP

2.2.2. XIP

XIP is accessible to DMA, processor load/store, and processor instruction fetch. This address range contains various

mirrors of a 64 MB space which is mapped to external memory devices. On RP2350 the lower 32 MB is occupied by the

QSPI Memory Interface (QMI), and the remainder is reserved. QMI controls are in the APB register section.

NOTE

XIP_SRAM_BASE no longer exists as a separate address range. Cache-as-SRAM is now achieved by pinning cache lines

within the cached XIP address space.
