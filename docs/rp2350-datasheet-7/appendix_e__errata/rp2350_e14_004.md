# RP2350-E14

RP2350-E14

| Reference | RP2350-E14 |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | The bootrom connect_internal_flash() function always uses pin 0, ignoring any configured FLASH_DEVINFO CS1 chip select pin |
| Affects | RP2350 A2 |
| Description | When using the bootrom function connect_internal_flash() to configure CS1 (for instance, during a flash boot), the bootrom always configures the pad registers for pin 0, ignoring any CS1 pin specified in FLASH_DEVINFO. As a result, the specified CS1 pin remains isolated (see Section 9.7). Accesses to the QSPI device connected to the second chip select fails unless CS1 is connected to pin 0. FLASH_DEVINFO can be configured in OTP or at runtime. For more information, see flash_devinfo16_ptr. |
| Workaround | Manually configure the CS1 pads registers to remove the isolation after using the bootrom connect_internal_flash() function. Alternatively, connect CS1 to pin 0. |
