| Summary | Interactions between CHAIN TO and ABORT of active channels _ |
| Affects | RP2350 A2, RP2350 A3, RP2350 A4 |
| Description | The CHAN_ABORT register commands a DMA channel to stop issuing transfers, and to clear its BUSY flag once in-flight transfers have completed. This was originally intended for recovering channels that are stuck with their DREQ low. An ABORT is initiated by writing a bitmap of aborted channels to CHAN_ABORT. Bits remain set until each channel comes to rest. This erratum is a compound of two behaviours: first, aborting a channel will cause its CHAIN TO to fire, if _ and only if the aborted channel is the last channel to have completed a write transfer. Second, a channel undergoing an ABORT is susceptible to be re-triggered on the last cycle before the ABORT register clears, because the channel is both inactive and enabled on this cycle, and the ABORT itself doesn’t inhibit triggering. However, since the ABORT is still in effect, the transfer count is held at zero. On the cycle after the ABORT finishes, the channel completes because its transfer counter is zero. This causes the channel’s IRQ and CHAIN TO to fire on the cycle after the ABORT completes. _ These two behaviours are problematic when aborting multiple channels that chain to one another, since they may cause the channels to immediately restart post-abort. |
| Workaround | Before aborting an active channel, clear the EN bit (CH0_CTRL_TRIG.EN) of both the aborted channel and any channel it chains to. This ensures the channel isn’t susceptible to re-triggering. |
