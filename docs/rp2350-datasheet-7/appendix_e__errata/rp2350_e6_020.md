# RP2350-E6

RP2350-E6

| Reference | RP2350-E6 |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | PMPCFGx RWX fields are transposed |
| Affects | RP2350 A2, RP2350 A3, RP2350 A4 |
| Description | The Physical Memory Protection unit (PMP) defines read, write and execute permissions (RWX) for configurable ranges of physical memory. The RWX permissions for four regions are packed into each 32- bit PMPCFG register, PMPCFG0 through PMPCFG3. Per the RISC-V privileged ISA specification, the permission fields are ordered X, W, R from MSB to LSB. Hazard3 implements them in the order R, W, X. This means software using the correct bit order will have its read permissions applied as execute, and vice versa. (See upstream commit 7d37029.) |
| Workaround | When configuring PMP with X != R, use the bit order implemented by this version of Hazard3. In the SDK, the hardware/regs/rvcsr.h register header provides bitfield definitions for the as-implemented order when building for RP2350. |
