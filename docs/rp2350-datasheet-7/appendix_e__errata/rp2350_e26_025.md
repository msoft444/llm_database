| Summary | RCP random delays can create a side-channel |
| Affects | RP2350 A2, RP2350 A3, RP2350 A4 |
| Description | The RCP delay is implemented as a coprocessor stall; this has the effect of completely pausing the associated core. As the core is effectively halted for the duration of the delay, this represents a significant reduction in gate toggle activity across the chip if there are no other bus managers active (e.g. other CPU or DMA). The reduction in toggle activity causes a reduction in DVDD current, and the typical length of the delay means that the reduction is measureable outside of the chip. The reduction in current and subsequent increase may create a fault injection trigger point. Instructions immediately after an RCP delay operation can be more reliably targeted, undoing the cumulative effect of clock randomisation. A second-order effect of the RCP delay probability distribution is that after N RCP instructions for large N, the added latency converges to a normal distribution centred on N * 63 cycles. Therefore, instructions after a known number of RCP delays are statistically easier to target. With these two factors in mind, programmers should use RCP delays in Secure code with great care. In particular, avoid using RCP delays: • Inside inner loops that may be executed many times. • As part of boilerplate assembly in function prologues/epilogues. • Immediately prior to particularly critical actions, such as modifying ACCESSCTRL. As a mitigation, as of RP2350 A3, the bootrom uses the non-delay variant for all RCP instructions. |
| Workaround | Use of the non-delay RCP instruction variant is recommended. |
