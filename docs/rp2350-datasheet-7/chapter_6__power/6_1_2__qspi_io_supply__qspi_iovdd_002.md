# 6.1.2. QSPI IO supply (QSPI_IOVDD)

6.1.2. QSPI IO supply (QSPI_IOVDD)

QSPI_IOVDD provides the IO supply for the chip’s QSPI interface, and should be powered at a nominal voltage between

1.8 V and 3.3 V. The supply voltage sets the external signal level for the QSPI interface, and should be chosen based on

the level required, see Section 14.9 for details. In most applications the QSPI interface will be connected to an external

flash device, which will determine the required signal level.

If the QSPI interface is powered at a nominal 1.8 V, the IO input thresholds should be adjusted by setting the

VOLTAGE_SELECT register to 1. VOLTAGE_SELECT is set to 0 by default, which results in input thresholds that are valid

for a nominal IO voltage between 2.5 V and 3.3 V. See Chapter 9 for details.

CAUTION

Powering the IOVDD at 1.8 V with input thresholds set for a 2.5 V to 3.3 V supply is a safe operating mode, but will

result in input thresholds that do not meet specification. Powering the IO at voltages greater than 1.8 V with input

thresholds set for a 1.8 V supply may result in damage to the chip.
