# 9.7. Pad isolation latches

9.7. Pad isolation latches

RP2350 features extended low-power states that allow all internal logic, with the exception of POWMAN and some

CoreSight debug logic, to fully power down under software control. This includes powering down all peripherals, the IO

muxing, and the pad control registers, which brings with it the risk that pad signals may experience unwanted

transitions when entering and exiting low-power states.

To ensure that pad states are well-defined at all times, all signals passing from the switched core power domain to the

pads pass through isolation latches. In normal operation, the latches are transparent, so the pads are controlled fully by

logic inside the switched core power domain, such as UARTs or the processors. However, when the ISO bit for each pad

is set (e.g. GPIO0.ISO) or the switched core domain is powered down, the control signals currently presented to that pad

are latched until the isolation is disabled. This includes the output enable state, output high/low level, and pull-up/pull-

down resistor enable. The input signal from the pad back into the switched core domain is not isolated.

Consequently, when switched core logic is powered down, all Bank 0 and Bank 1 pads maintain the output state they

held immediately before the power down, unless overridden by always-on logic in POWMAN. When the switched core

power domain powers back up, all the GPIO ISO bits reset to 1, so the pre-power down state continues to be maintained

until user software starts up and clears the ISO bit to indicate it is ready to use the pad again. Pads whose IO muxing

has not yet been set up can be left isolated indefinitely, and will maintain their pre-power down state.

when software has finished setting up the IO muxing for a given pad, and the peripheral that is to be muxed in, the ISO

bit should be cleared. At this point the isolation latches will become transparent again: output signals passing through

the IO muxing block are now reflected in the pad output state, so peripherals can communicate with the outside world.

This process allows the switched core domain to be power cycled without causing any transitions on the pad outputs

that may interfere with the operation of external hardware connected to the pads.

NOTE

Non-SDK applications ported from RP2040 must clear the ISO bit before using a GPIO, as this feature was not

present on RP2040. The SDK automatically clears the ISO bit when gpio_set_function() is called.

The isolation latches themselves are reset by the always-on power domain reset, namely any one of:

• Power-on reset
• Brownout reset
• RUN pin being asserted low
• SW-DP CDBGRSTREQ
• RP-AP rescue reset

The latches reset to the reset value of the signal being isolated. For example, on Bank 0 GPIOs, the input enable control

(GPIO0.IE) resets to 0 (input-disabled), so the isolation latches for these signals also take a reset value of 0. Resetting

the isolation latch forces the pad to assume its reset state even if it is currently isolated.

The ISO control bits (e.g. GPIO0.ISO) are reset by the top-level switched core domain isolation signal, which is asserted

by POWMAN before powering down the switched core domain and de-asserted after it is powered up. This means that

entering and exiting a sleep state where the switched core domain is unpowered leaves all GPIOs isolated after power

up; you can then re-engage them individually. The ISO control bits are not reset by the PADS register block reset driven

by the RESETS control registers: resetting the PADS register block returns non-isolated pads to their reset state, but has

no effect on isolated pads.
