# 5.1.5. Blocks and block loops

5.1.5. Blocks and block loops

5.1.5.1. Blocks

IMAGE_DEFs and PARTITION_TABLEs are both examples of blocks. A block is a recognisable, self-checking data structure

containing one or more distinct data items. The type of the first item in a block defines the type of that entire block.

Blocks are backwards and forwards compatible; item types will not be changed in the future in ways that could cause

existing code to misinterpret data. Consumers of blocks (including the bootrom) must skip items within the block

whose types are currently listed as reserved; encountering reserved item types must not cause a block to fail validation.

To be considered valid, a block must have the following properties:

• it must begin with the 4 byte magic header, PICOBIN_BLOCK_MARKER_START (0xffffded3)
• the end of each (variably-sized) item must also be the start of another valid item
• the last item must have type PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_2BS_LAST and specify the correct full length of the block
• it must end with the 4 byte magic footer, PICOBIN_BLOCK_MARKER_END (0xab123579)

The magic header and footer values are chosen to be unlikely to appear in executable Arm and RISC-V code. For more

information about the block format, see Section 5.9.1.

Given a region of memory or flash (such as a partition), blocks are found by searching the first 4 kB of that given region

(for flash boot) or the entire region (for RAM/OTP image boots) for a valid block which is part of a valid block loop.

Currently IMAGE_DEFs and PARTITION_TABLEs are the only types of block used by the RP2350 bootrom, but the block format

reserves encoding space for future expansion.

5.1.5.2. Block loops

A block loop is a cyclic linked list of blocks (a linked loop). Each block has a relative pointer to the next block, and the

last block must link to the first. A single block can form a block loop by linking back to itself with a relative pointer of 0.

The first block in a loop must have the lowest address of all blocks in the loop.

The purpose of a block loop is threefold:

• to discover which blocks belong to the same image without a brute-force search
• to allow metadata to be appended in post-link processing steps
• to detect parts of the binary being overwritten in a way that breaks the loop

For flash image boot the bootrom searches the first 4 kB of flash; the 4 kB size is a compromise between allowing

flexibility for different languages' memory layouts, while avoiding scanning too much flash when trying different flash

access modes and QSPI clock frequencies. flash partition boot also limits its search to the first 4 kB of the partition.

The search window may be larger, such as a RAM image boot following a UF2 SRAM download, where the search

window is all of SRAM. For the fastest boot time, locate the first block as close to the beginning of the binary as

possible.

Block loops support multiple blocks because:

• Signing an image duplicates the existing IMAGE_DEF and adds another (bigger) IMAGE_DEF with additional signature

information.
• An image may contain multiple IMAGE_DEFs, for example, with different signing keys.

RP2350 Datasheet

• Placing a block at both the beginning and end of an image can detect some partial overwrites of the image (for

example, due to an overly enthusiastic absolute-addressed UF2 download). The SDK does this by default. Hashing

or signing the entire image is more robust, since it detects corruption in the middle of the image.
• A universal binary image might contain code for both Arm and RISC-V, including IMAGE_DEFs for both.
• PARTITION_TABLEs and IMAGE_DEFs are both present in the same block loop in the case of an embedded partition table.

If a block loop contains multiple IMAGE_DEFs or multiple PARTITION_TABLEs, the winner is generally the last one seen in

linked-list order. The exception is the case of two IMAGE_DEFs for different architectures (Arm and RISC-V); an IMAGE_DEF

for the architecture currently executing the bootrom is always preferred over one for a different architecture.
