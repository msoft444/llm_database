# 5.2.3. POWMAN boot vector

5.2.3. POWMAN boot vector

POWMAN contains scratch registers similar to the watchdog scratch registers, which persist over power-down of the

switched core power domain, in addition to most system resets. These registers allow users to install their own boot

handler, and divert control away from the main boot sequence on non-POR/BOR resets. It recognises the following

values written to BOOT0 through BOOT3:

• BOOT0: magic number 0xb007c0d3
• BOOT1: Entry point XORed with magic -0xb007c0d3 (0x4ff83f2d)
• BOOT2: Stack pointer
• BOOT3: Entry point

Use this to vector into code preloaded in RAM which was retained during a low-power state.

If either of the magic numbers mismatch, POWMAN vector boot does not take place. If the numbers match, the

bootrom zeroes BOOT0 before entering the vector, so that the behaviour does not persist over subsequent reboots.

The POWMAN boot vector is permitted to return. The boot sequence continues as normal after a return from POWMAN

vector boot, as though the vector boot had not taken place. There is no requirement for the vector to preserve the global

pointer (gp) register on RISC-V. Use this to perform any additional setup required for the boot path, such as issuing a

power-up command to an external QSPI device that may have been powered down (for example, through a B9h power-

down command).

The entry point (pc) must have the LSB set on Arm (the Thumb bit) and clear on RISC-V. If this condition is not met, the

bootrom assumes you have passed a RISC-V function pointer to an Arm processor (or vice versa) and hangs the core

rather than continuing, since executing code for the wrong architecture has spectacularly undefined consequences.

The linker should automatically set the Thumb bit appropriately for a function pointer relocation, but this is something to

be aware of if you pass hardcoded values such as the base of SRAM: this is correctly passed as 0x20000001 on Arm

(Thumb bit set) and 0x20000000 on RISC-V (no Thumb bit, halfword-aligned).
