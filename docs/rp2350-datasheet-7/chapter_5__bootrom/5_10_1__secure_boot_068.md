# 5.10.1. Secure boot

5.10.1. Secure boot

To enable secure boot on RP2350, you must:

1. Set the SHA-256 hashes of the boot keys you will be using in BOOTKEY0_0 onwards

2. Set bits in BOOT_FLAGS1.KEY_VALID for the keys you will be using

3. Optionally set bits in BOOT_FLAGS1.KEY_INVALID for all unused keys — this is recommended to prevent a

malicious actor installing their own boot keys at a later date

4. Set CRIT1.SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE to turn on secure boot.

NOTE

These steps are the minimum for enabling secure boot support in the bootrom. See Section 10.5 for additional steps

you must take to fully secure your device, such as disabling hardware debug.

All of the above can be achieved with picotool. For example, when signing using picotool seal you can add an OTP JSON

output file, to which it will add the relevant OTP field values to enable secure boot (BOOTKEY0_0,

BOOT_FLAGS1.KEY_VALID and CRIT1.SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE):

RP2350 Datasheet

$ picotool seal --sign unsigned.elf signed.elf private.pem /path/to/otp.json

To configure the SDK to output this OTP JSON file when signing, add the following command to your CMakeLists.txt:

pico_set_otp_key_output_file(target_name /path/to/otp.json)

You can then issue the following command to write this OTP JSON file to the device, thus enabling secure boot:

$ picotool otp load /path/to/otp.json

Once secure boot is enabled, the bootrom verifies signatures of images from all supported media: flash, OTP, and

images preloaded into SRAM via the UART and USB bootloaders. At this point you lose the ability to run unsigned

images; during development you may find it more convenient to leave secure boot disabled. The next section describes

the generation of signed images to run on a secure-boot-enabled device.
