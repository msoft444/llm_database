# 5.1.17. Try before you buy

5.1.17. Try before you buy

Try before you buy (abbreviated TBYB) is an IMAGE_DEF-only feature that allows for a completely safe cycle of version

upgrade:

1. An executable image is running from say partition B.

2. A new image is downloaded into partition A.

3. On download completion, a FLASH_UPDATE reboot is performed for the newly updated partition A.

4. The bootrom will preferentially try to boot partition A (due to the flash update). Note that a non TBYB image will

always be chosen over a TBYB image in A/B partitions during a normal non-FLASH_UPDATE boot.

◦If the new image fails validation/signature then the old image in partition B will be used on subsequent (non-

FLASH_UPDATE) boots, recovering from the failed upgrade.

5. If the new image is valid (and correctly signed if necessary), it is entered under a watchdog timer, and has 16.7

seconds to mark itself OK via the explicit_buy() function.

◦If the image calls back, the first 4 kB sector of the other partition (containing image B) is erased, and the

TBYB flag of the current image is cleared, so that A becomes the preferred partition for subsequent boots.

◦If the image does not call back within the allotted time, then the system reboots, and will continue to boot

partition B (containing the original image) as partition A is still marked as TBYB image.

The erase of the first sector of the opposite partition in the A/B pair severs its image’s block loop, rendering it

unbootable. This ensures the tentative image booted under TBYB becomes the preferred boot image going forward,

even if the opposite image had a higher version.

The watchdog timeout is fixed at 16.7 seconds (24-bit count on a 1-microsecond timebase). This can be shortened after

entering the target image, for example if it only needs a few hundred milliseconds for its self-test routine. It can also be

extended by reloading the watchdog counter, at the risk of getting stuck in the tentative image if it fails in a way that

repeatedly reloads the watchdog.
