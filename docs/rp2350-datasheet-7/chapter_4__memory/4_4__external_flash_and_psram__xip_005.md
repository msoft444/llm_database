4.4. External flash and PSRAM (XIP)

RP2350 can access external flash and PSRAM via its execute-in-place (XIP) subsystem. The term execute-in-place

refers to external memory mapped directly into the chip’s internal address space. This enables you to execute code as-

is from the external memory without explicitly copying into on-chip SRAM. For example, a processor instruction fetch

from AHB address 0x10001234 results in a QSPI memory interface fetch from address 0x001234 in an external flash device.

A 16 kB on-chip cache retains the values of recent reads and writes. This reduces the chances that XIP bus accesses

must go to external memory, improving the average throughput and latency of the XIP interface. The cache is physically

structured as two 8 kB banks, interleaving odd and even cache lines of 8-byte granularity over the two banks. This

allows processors to access multiple cache lines during the same cycle. Logically, the XIP cache behaves as a single

16 kB cache.

subsystem. The cache

is split into two banks

for performance, but

behaves as a single

16 kB cache. XIP

accesses first query

the cache. If a cache

entry is not found, the

QMI generates an

external serial access,

adds the resulting

data to the cache, and

forwards it on to the

system bus (for reads)

or merges it with the

AHB write data (for

writes).

When booting from flash, the RP2350 bootrom (Chapter 5) sets up a baseline QMI execute-in-place configuration. User

code may later reconfigure this to improve performance for a specific flash device. QSPI clock divisors can be changed

at any time, including whilst executing from XIP. Other reconfiguration requires a momentary disable of the interface.
