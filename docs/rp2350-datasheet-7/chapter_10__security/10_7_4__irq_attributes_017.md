# 10.7.4. IRQ attributes

10.7.4. IRQ attributes

Each of the four shared DMA interrupt lines (IRQs) has a configurable security level. The IRQ’s security level is

compared with channel security levels, and with the bus privilege of accesses to the DMA’s interrupt control registers, to

determine:

• Whether a bus access is permitted to read/write the INTE/INTF/INTS registers for this IRQ
• Whether a given channel will be visible in this IRQ’s INTS register (and therefore whether that channel will cause

assertion of this IRQ)
• Whether a given channel can have its interrupt pending flag set/cleared via this IRQ’s INTF/INTS registers

For a bus access to view/configure an IRQ, it must have a security level greater than or equal to the IRQ’s security level.

For an IRQ to observe a channel’s interrupt pending flag, the IRQ must have a security level greater than or equal to the

channel’s security level. Consequently, for a bus to observe a channel’s interrupt status, the bus access security level

must be greater than or equal to the channel’s security level.

For an IRQ to observe a channel’s interrupt pending flag, it must have a security level greater than or equal to the

channel’s security level.

There is only one INTR register. Which channels' interrupts can be observed and cleared through INTR is determined by

comparing channel security levels to the security level of the INTR bus access.
