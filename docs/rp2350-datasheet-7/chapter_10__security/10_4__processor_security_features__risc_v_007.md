10.4. Processor security features (RISC-V)

The Hazard3 processors on RP2350 implement the following standard RISC-V security features:

• Machine and User execution modes (M-mode and U-mode)
• The Physical Memory Protection unit (PMP)

M-mode has full access to the processor’s internal status registers, but U-mode does not. The processor’s bus

accesses are tagged with its current execution mode and filtered by ACCESSCTRL bus filters, as described in Section

10.6.2.

The processor starts in M-mode, and enters M-mode upon taking any trap (exception or interrupt). It enters U-mode only

by executing a return-from-M-mode instruction, mret, with previous privilege set to U-mode. This means all interrupts

initially target M-mode, but can be de-privileged to U-mode via software routing. Because stacks are software-managed

on RISC-V, software cooperation is required to fully separate the two execution contexts, though there are enough

hardware hooks to make this possible. For more details about interrupts and exceptions on RISC-V, and how they relate

to the core’s privilege levels, see Section 3.8.4.

The PMP is a memory protection unit built into each RISC-V processor that filters every instruction execution address

and every load/store address against a list of permission regions. The Hazard3 instances on RP2350 are configured

with 8 PMP regions each, with a 32-byte granule and naturally-aligned power-of-2 region support only.

Additionally, there are 3 PMP-hardwired regions, which set a default User-mode RW permission on peripherals and a

User-mode RWX permission on the ROM. These are assigned region numbers 8 through 10. Because lower-numbered

regions always take precedence, any dynamically-configured region can override these hardwired regions.

There are many more peripherals than PMP regions. In typical use-cases, the programmer assigns these peripherals

blanket U-mode RW permissions. Because hardwired regions are much cheaper than dynamically-configured regions, it

was more efficient to use hardwired regions. These regions are included because the peripherals are expected to be

assigned using ACCESSCTRL, rather than PMP. The hardwired regions play a similar role to the Exempt regions in the

RP2350 Cortex-M IDAU.

Together with the ACCESSCTRL filters, these PMP regions are an effective mechanism for partitioning between

addresses accessible from U-mode and addresses not accessible from U-mode. Hazard3 includes one custom PMP

feature, the PMPCFGM0 register, which allows the PMP to set M-mode permissions as well as U-mode without locking.

This is useful for preventing accidental (but not deliberate) access to a memory region.
