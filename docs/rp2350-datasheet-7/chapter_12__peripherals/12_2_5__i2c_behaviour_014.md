# 12.2.5. I2C behaviour

12.2.5. I2C behaviour

The DW_apb_i2c can be controlled with software to be one of the following:

• An I2C master only, communicating with other I2C slaves
• An I2C slave only, communicating with one or more I2C masters.

The master is responsible for generating the clock and controlling the transfer of data. The slave is responsible for

either transmitting or receiving data to and from the master. The acknowledgement of data is sent by the device that is

receiving data, which can be either a master or a slave. As mentioned previously, the I2C protocol also allows multiple

masters to reside on the I2C bus and uses an arbitration procedure to determine bus ownership.

Each slave has a unique address determined by the system designer. When a master wants to communicate with a

slave:

1. The master transmits a START/RESTART condition that is then followed by the slave’s address and a control bit

(R/W) to determine if the master wants to transmit data or receive data from the slave.

2. The slave then sends an acknowledge (ACK) pulse after the address.

When the master (master-transmitter) writes to the slave (slave-receiver), the receiver gets one byte of data. This

transaction continues until the master terminates the transmission with a STOP condition.

When the master reads from a slave (master-receiver), the slave transmits (slave-transmitter) a byte of data to the

master. The master then acknowledges the transaction with the ACK pulse. This transaction continues until the master

terminates the transmission by not acknowledging (NACK) the transaction after the last byte is received, and then the

master issues a STOP condition or addresses another slave after issuing a RESTART condition. This behaviour is

illustrated in Figure 69.

The DW_apb_i2c is a synchronous serial interface. The SDA line is a bidirectional signal that changes only while the SCL line

is low except for STOP, START, and RESTART conditions. The output drivers are open-drain or open-collector to perform

wire-AND functions on the bus. The maximum number of devices on the bus is limited by only the maximum

capacitance specification of 400 pF. Data is transmitted in byte packages.

The I2C protocols implemented in DW_apb_i2c are described in more details in Section 12.2.6.

12.2.5.1. START and STOP generation

When operating as an I2C master, putting data into the TX FIFO causes the DW_apb_i2c to generate a START condition on

the I2C bus. Writing a 1 to IC_DATA_CMD.STOP causes the DW_apb_i2c to generate a STOP condition on the I2C bus; a

STOP condition is not issued if this bit is not set, even if the TX FIFO is empty.

When operating as a slave, the DW_apb_i2c does not generate START and STOP conditions, as per the protocol. However,

if a read request is made to the DW_apb_i2c, it holds the SCL line low until read data has been supplied to it. This stalls the

I2C bus until read data is provided to the slave DW_apb_i2c, or the DW_apb_i2c slave is disabled by writing a 0 to

IC_ENABLE.ENABLE.

12.2.5.2. Combined formats

The DW_apb_i2c supports mixed read and write combined format transactions in both 7-bit and 10-bit addressing modes.

The DW_apb_i2c does not support mixed address and mixed address format - that is, a 7-bit address transaction followed

by a 10-bit address transaction or vice versa-combined format transactions. To initiate combined format transfers,

IC_CON.IC_RESTART_EN should be set to 1. With this value set and operating as a master, when the DW_apb_i2c

completes an I2C transfer, it checks the TX FIFO and executes the next transfer. If the direction of this transfer differs

from the previous transfer, the combined format is used to issue the transfer. If the TX FIFO is empty when the current

I2C transfer completes:

• IC_DATA_CMD.STOP is checked and:

◦If set to 1, a STOP bit is issued.

◦If set to 0, the SCL is held low until the next command is written to the TX FIFO.

For more details, refer to Section 12.2.7.
