# 12.8.3. Alarms

12.8.3. Alarms

The timer has 4 alarms, and outputs a separate interrupt for each alarm. The alarms match on the lower 32 bits of the

64-bit counter, which means they can be fired at a maximum of 232 microseconds into the future. This is equivalent to:

• 232 ÷ 106: ~4295 seconds
• 4295 ÷ 60: ~72 minutes

NOTE

This timer supports alarm intervals on the order of one microsecond to one hour. For a longer alarm, see Section

12.10.

To enable an alarm:

1. Enable the interrupt at the timer with a write to the appropriate alarm bit in INTE (e.g. (1 << 0) for ALARM0).

2. Enable the appropriate timer interrupt at the processor (see Section 3.2).

3. Write the time you would like the interrupt to fire to ALARM0 (i.e. the current value in TIMERAWL plus your desired alarm

time in microseconds). Writing the time to the ALARM register sets the ARMED bit as a side effect.

Once the alarm has fired, the ARMED bit clears to 0. To clear the latched interrupt, write a 1 to the appropriate bit in INTR.
