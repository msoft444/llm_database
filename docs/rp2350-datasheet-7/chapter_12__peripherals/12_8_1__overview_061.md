# 12.8.1. Overview

12.8.1. Overview

The system timer peripheral on RP2350 provides a microsecond timebase for the system, and generates interrupts

based on this timebase. RP2350 has two instances of the system timer: TIMER0 and TIMER1. This allows for two

separately controlled timers, each in a different security domain. It supports the following features:

• A single 64-bit counter, incrementing once per microsecond

◦Read from a pair of latching registers for race-free reads over a 32-bit bus
• Four alarms that match on the lower 32 bits of the counter and generate IRQ on match

The timer uses a one microsecond reference generated by the tick generators (see Section 8.5), and derived from the

reference clock (Figure 33), which itself is usually connected directly to the crystal oscillator (Section 8.2).

The 64-bit counter effectively cannot overflow (thousands of years at 1 MHz), so the system timer is completely

monotonic in practice.

12.8.1.1. Changes from RP2040

• RP2350 now has two timer instances: TIMER0 and TIMER1
• On RP2350, the tick source for each timer comes from the system-level tick generators (see Section 8.5)
• RP2350 added two new registers: LOCKED is used to disable write access to the timer, and SOURCE allows the timer to

count system clock cycles rather than a 1 μs tick

12.8.1.2. Other timer resources on RP2350

The system timer provides a global timebase for software. RP2350 has a number of other programmable counter

resources which can provide regular interrupts, or trigger DMA transfers.

• The PWM (Section 12.5) contains 12× 16-bit programmable counters. These counters:

◦run at up to system speed

◦can generate interrupts to either of two system IRQ lines

◦can be continuously reprogrammed via the DMA

◦can trigger DMA transfers to other peripherals
• 12× PIO state machines (Chapter 11) can count 32-bit values at system speed, and generate interrupts.
• The DMA (Section 12.6) has four internal pacing timers which trigger transfers at regular intervals.
• Each Cortex-M33 core (Section 3.7) has a standard 24-bit SysTick timer, counting either the microsecond tick

(Section 8.5) or the system clock.
• SIO has a standard 64-bit RISC-V platform timer (Section 3.1.8). Arm and RISC-V software can use this timer.
• The Power Manager (Chapter 6) incorporates a 64-bit timer (AON Timer) which nominally counts milliseconds (see

Section 12.10). This is the only timer that runs when the chip is in its lowest power state, with all switchable power

domains powered down. It is used to schedule power-ups.
