# 12.12.2. Configuration

12.12.2. Configuration

The TRNG block contains three different built-in entropy checking mechanisms: At reset, these are all enabled by default

and hence do not require explicit enabling.

You can configure the TRNG block in the following ways:

• Configure the frequency of the ROSC by selecting of one of four ROSC chain lengths, see TRNG_CONFIG.
• Configure the ROSC sampling period in terms of system clock ticks, see SAMPLE_CNT1.

Because the system clock generally runs much faster than the ROSC, the sampling period is expected to be at least a

few tens of system clock ticks.

Because the characteristics of the TRNG ROSC and system clock frequency will differ for each implementation of the

TRNG IP block, Arm details a TRNG characterisation procedure to determine the most appropriate ROSC chain length

and sampling frequency settings on each SoC design. For details about that characterisation procedure, see ARM

TrustZone True Number Generator.

Software drivers for the RP2350 TRNG block do not utilise the standard approach (see Section 12.12.4). As a result,

software does not configure the ROSC length and sample count settings provided by the Arm characterisation

procedure.

When configuring the TRNG block, consider the following principles:

• As average generation time increases, result quality increases and failed entropy checks decrease.
• A low sample count decreases average generation time, but increases the chance of NIST test-failing results and

failed entropy checks.

For acceptable results with an average generation time of about 2 milliseconds, use ROSC chain length settings of 0 or

1 and sample count settings of 20-25.

Larger sample count settings (e.g. 100) provide proportionately slower average generation times. These settings

significantly reduce, but do not eliminate NIST test failures and entropy check failures. Results occasionally take an

especially long time to generate.
