# 12.2.11. Spike suppression

12.2.11. Spike suppression

The DW_apb_i2c contains programmable spike suppression logic that matches requirements imposed by the I2C Bus

Specification for SS/FS modes. This logic is based on counters that monitor the input signals (SCL and SDA), checking if

they remain stable for a predetermined amount of ic_clk cycles before they are sampled internally. There is one

separate counter for each signal (SCL and SDA). The number of ic_clk cycles can be programmed by the user. The value

should account for the frequency of ic_clk and the relevant spike length specification. Each counter starts whenever its

input signal changes value. Depending on the behaviour of the input signal, one of the following scenarios occurs:

• The input signal remains unchanged until the counter reaches its count limit value. When this happens, the counter

resets and stops, and the internal version of the signal updates to the input value.
• The input signal changes again before the counter reaches its count limit value. When this happens, the counter

resets and stops, but the internal version of the signal does not update.

The timing diagram in Figure 87 illustrates the behaviour described above.

There is a 2-stage synchronizer on the SCL input. For the sake of simplicity, this synchronization delay was not

included in the timing diagram in Figure 87.

The I2C Bus Specification calls for different maximum spike lengths according to the operating mode (50 ns for SS and

FS). Register IC_FS_SPKLEN holds the maximum spike length for SS and FS modes.

This register is 8 bits wide and accessible through the APB interface for reads and writes. However, you can only write

to this register when the DW_apb_i2c is disabled. The minimum value that can be programmed into these registers is one;

attempting to program a value smaller than one results in the value one being written.

The default value for these registers is based on the value of 100 ns for ic_clk period, so should be updated for the

clk_sys period in use on RP2350.

• Because the minimum value that can be programmed into the IC_FS_SPKLEN register is one, the spike length

specification can be exceeded for low frequencies of ic_clk. Consider the simple example of a 10 MHz (100 ns

period) ic_clk; in this case, the minimum spike length that can be programmed is 100 ns, which means that

spikes up to this length are suppressed.
• Standard synchronization logic (two flip-flops in series) is implemented upstream of the spike suppression

logic and is not affected in any way by the contents of the spike length registers or the operation of the spike

suppression logic; the two operations (synchronization and spike suppression) are completely independent.

Because the SCL and SDA inputs are asynchronous to ic_clk, there is one ic_clk cycle uncertainty in the sampling

of these signals. Depending on when they occur relative to the rising edge of ic_clk, spikes of the same original

length might show a difference of one ic_clk cycle after being sampled.
• Spike suppression is symmetrical; the behaviour is exactly the same for transitions from zero to one and from
