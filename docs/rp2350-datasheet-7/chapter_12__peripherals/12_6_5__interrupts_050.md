# 12.6.5. Interrupts

12.6.5. Interrupts

Each channel can generate interrupts; these can be masked on a per-channel basis using one of the four identical

interrupt enable registers, INTE0 through INTE3. There are three circumstances where a channel raises an interrupt

request:

• On the completion of each transfer sequence, if CTRL.IRQ_QUIET is disabled
• On receiving a null trigger, if CTRL.IRQ_QUIET is enabled
• On a read or write bus error

The masked interrupt status is visible in the INTS registers; there is one bit for each channel. Interrupts are cleared by

writing a bit mask to INTS. One idiom for acknowledging interrupts is to read INTS, then write the same value back, so

only enabled interrupts are cleared.

The RP2350 DMA provides four system IRQs, with independent masking and status registers (e.g. INTE0, INTE1). Any

combination of channel interrupt requests can be routed to each system IRQ, though generally software only routes

each channel interrupt to a single system IRQ. For example:

• Some channels can be given a higher priority in the system interrupt controller, if they have particularly tight timing

requirements.
• In multiprocessor systems, different channel interrupts can be routed independently to different cores.
• When channels are assigned to a mixture of security domains, IRQs can also be assigned, so that software in each

security domain can get interrupts from its own channels.

For debugging purposes, the INTF registers can force any channel interrupt to be asserted, which will cause assertion of

any system IRQs that have that channel interrupt’s enable bit set in their respective INTE registers.
