# 10.8. OTP

10.8. OTP

RP2350 contains 8 kB of OTP storage, organised as 4096 × 24-bit rows with hardware ECC protection. This is the only

mutable, on-die, non-volatile storage. Boot signing keys and decryption keys are stored in OTP, and as such it is a vital

part of the security architecture. This section gives a brief summary of OTP hardware protection features; Chapter 13

documents the hardware in full.

The RP2350 OTP subystem adds a hardware layer on top of the OTP storage array, to protect sensitive contents:

• OTP is protected at a 128-byte page granularity (see Section 13.5)

◦Each page can be fully accessible, read-only, or fully inacessible

◦Locks are defined separately for Secure, Non-secure and bootloader access

◦Programming OTP lock locations starting at PAGE0_LOCK0 applies locks permanently

◦Writing to registers starting at SW_LOCK0 advances locks to a less-permissive state until the next OTP reset
• OTP control registers used to access the SBPI interface are hardwired for Secure access only

◦The SBPI interface is used to program the OTP and configure power supply and analogue hardware
• The guarded read aliases provide higher assurance against deliberate OTP power supply manipulation during

reads (Section 13.1.1)
• Hardware reads the OTP array at startup for security hardware configuration (Section 13.3.4)

◦The critical flags (Section 13.4) enable secure boot, enable the glitch detectors, and disable debug

◦The OTP hardware access keys (Section 13.5.2) provide further protection for OTP pages

◦The debug keys (Section 3.5.9.2) are an additional mechanism to conditionally lock down debug access

OTP also contains configuration for the RP2350 bootrom, particularly its secure boot implementation. Section 13.10

lists all predefined OTP data locations. Boot configuration is stored in page 1, starting from BOOT_FLAGS0.

The bootrom can load and run code stored in OTP; see the bootrom documentation in Section 5.10.7, and the OTP data

listings starting from OTPBOOT_SRC. When secure boot is enabled, code loaded from OTP is subject to all of the usual

requirements for image signing and versioning, so this code can form part of your secure boot chain. The chain_image()

ROM API allows your OTP-resident bootloader to call back into the ROM to verify the next boot stage that it has loaded.
