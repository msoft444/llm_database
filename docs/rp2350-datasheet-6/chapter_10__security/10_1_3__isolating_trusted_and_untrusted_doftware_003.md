10.1.3. Isolating trusted and untrusted doftware

In security- or safety-critical applications, access must be limited to those who need it. For example, a JPEG decode

library should not be able to access the core voltage regulator and increase DVDD to 3.3 V (unless you are

decompressing a very large JPEG). The Cortex-M33 processors contain hardware that separates two execution

contexts, known as Secure and Non-secure, and enforces a number of invariants between them, such as:

• Non-secure code cannot access Secure memory
• The Secure context cannot execute Non-secure memory
• Non-secure code cannot directly access peripherals managed by Secure code
• Non-secure code cannot prevent Secure interrupts from being serviced

By making less of your code able to access your most critical hardware and data, you reduce the chance of accidentally

exposing this critical hardware and data to the outside world. For a high-level explanation of how the Cortex-M33

implements this, see Section 10.2. For full details, see Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual.

RP2350 Datasheet

To make the programming model of Secure and Non-secure software consistent, and to avoid overhead in Non-secure

code, RP2350 extends Secure/Non-secure separation throughout the system. For example, DMA channels can be

assigned for Secure or Non-secure use. Using this extended separation, Non-secure code can use DMA transfers to

accelerate peripheral accesses without endangering security model invariants (such as Non-secure code using the DMA

to read Secure memory).

The key hardware features that enable Secure/Non-secure separation throughout the system are:

• The Cortex-M33’s implementation of the Secure and Non-secure states (Section 10.2)
• The DMA’s implementation of matching per-channel security states (Section 10.7)
• The system-level bus access filtering implemented by ACCESSCTRL (Section 10.6)
• Peripheral-level filtering, such as the per-GPIO access filtering of the SIO GPIO registers (Section 3.1.1)

10.2. Processor security features (Arm)

The Cortex-M33 processors on RP2350 are configured with the following standard Arm security features:

• Support for the Armv8-M Security extension
• 8× security attribution unit (SAU) regions
• 8× Secure and 8× Non-secure memory protection unit (MPU) regions

These features are covered exhaustively in the Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual, the Cortex-M33 Technical

Reference Manual, and the Cortex-M33 section of this datasheet (Section 3.7). This section gives a high-level overview

of these features, as well as a description of the implementation-defined attribution unit included in RP2350.
