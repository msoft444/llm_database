RP2350 Datasheet

1.1. The chip

Dual Cortex-M33 or Hazard3 processors access RP2350’s memory and peripherals via AHB and APB bus fabric.

Code may execute directly from external memory through a dedicated QSPI memory interface in the execute-in-place

subsystem (XIP). The cache improves XIP performance significantly. Both flash and RAM can attach via this interface.

Debug is available via the SWD interface. This allows an external host to load, run, halt and inspect software running on

the system, or configure the execution trace output.

Internal SRAM can contain code or data. It is addressed as a single 520 kB region, but physically partitioned into 10

banks to allow simultaneous parallel access from different managers. All SRAM supports single-cycle access.

A high-bandwidth system DMA offloads repetitive data transfer tasks from the processors.

GPIO pins can be driven directly via single-cycle IO (SIO), or from a variety of dedicated logic functions such as the

hardware SPI, I2C, UART and PWM. Programmable IO controllers (PIO) can provide a wider variety of IO functions, or

supplement the number of fixed-function peripherals.

A USB controller with embedded PHY provides FS/LS Host or Device connectivity under software control.

Four or eight ADC inputs (depending on package size) are shared with GPIO pins.

Two PLLs provide a fixed 48 MHz clock for USB or ADC, and a flexible system clock up to 150 MHz. A crystal oscillator

provides a precise reference for the PLLs.

An internal voltage regulator supplies the core voltage, so you need generally only supply the IO voltage. It operates as a

switched mode buck converter when the system is awake, providing up to 200 mA at a variable output voltage, and can

switch to a low-quiescent-current LDO mode when the system is asleep, providing up to 1 mA for state retention.

The system features low-power states where unused logic is powered off, supporting wakeup from timer or IO events.

The amount of SRAM retained during power-down is configurable.

The internal 8 kB one-time-programmable storage (OTP) contains chip information such as unique identifiers, can be

used to configure hardware and bootrom security features, and can be programmed with user-supplied code and data.

The built-in bootrom implements direct boot from flash or OTP, and serial boot from USB or UART. Code signature

enforcement is supported for all boot media, using a key fingerprint registered in internal OTP storage. OTP can also

store decryption keys for encrypted boot, preventing flash contents from being read externally.

RISC-V architecture support is implemented by dynamically swapping the Cortex-M33 (Armv8-M) processors with

Hazard3 (RV32IMAC+) processors. Both architectures are available on all RP2350-family devices. The RISC-V cores

support debug over SWD, and can be programmed with the same SDK as the Arm cores.

1.2. Pinout reference

This section provides a quick reference for pinout and pin functions. Full details, including electrical specifications and

package drawings, can be found in Chapter 14.
