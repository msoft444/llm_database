# 6.3.4. Status

6.3.4. Status

To determine the status of the regulator, read the VREG_STS register, which contains two fields:

• VOUT_OK indicates whether the voltage regulator’s output is being correctly regulated. At power-on, VOUT_OK remains

low until the regulator has started up and the output voltage reaches the VOUT_OK assertion threshold (VOUT_OKTH.ASSERT).

It then remains high until the voltage drops below the VOUT_OK de-assertion threshold (VOUT_OKTH.DEASSERT), remaining low

until the output voltage is above the assertion threshold again. VOUT_OKTH.ASSERT is nominally 90% of the selected output

voltage, 0.99 V if the selected output voltage is 1.1 V, and VOUT_OKTH.DEASSERT is nominally 87% of the selected output

voltage, 0.957 V if the selected output voltage is 1.1 V. See Section 14.9.6 for details.
• STARTUP is high when the regulator is starting up, and remains high until the regulator’s operating mode or output

voltage are changed, either by software or the Power Manager

Adjusting the output voltage to a higher voltage will cause VOUT_OK to go low until the assertion threshold for the higher

voltage is reached. VOUT_OK will also go low if the regulator is placed in high-impedance mode.
