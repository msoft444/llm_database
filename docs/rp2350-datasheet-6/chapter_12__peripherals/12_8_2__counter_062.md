# 12.8.2. Counter

12.8.2. Counter

The timer has a 64-bit counter, but RP2350 only has a 32-bit data bus. This means that the TIME value is accessed

through a pair of registers. These are:

• TIMEHW and TIMELW to write the time
• TIMEHR and TIMELR to read the time

To use these pairs, access the lower register, L, followed by the higher register, H. In the read case, reading the L register

latches the value in the H register to provide an accurate time. To read the raw time without any latching, use TIMERAWH

and TIMERAWL.

CAUTION

Don’t write to the TIMEHW and TIMELW registers to force a new time value if other software may be using the timer. The

SDK uses the time value for timeouts, elapsed time, and more, and expects the value to increase monotonically.
