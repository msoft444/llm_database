Data

All PIO instructions execute in one clock cycle.

The function of the 5-bit Delay/side-set field depends on the state machine’s SIDESET_COUNT configuration:

• Up to 5 LSBs (5 minus SIDESET_COUNT) encode a number of idle cycles inserted between this instruction and the next.

RP2350 Datasheet

• Up to 5 MSBs, set by SIDESET_COUNT, encode a side-set (Section 11.5.1), which can assert a constant onto some

GPIOs, concurrently with main instruction execution.
