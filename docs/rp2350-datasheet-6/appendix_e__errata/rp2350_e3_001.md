| Summary | In QFN-60 package, GPIO NSMASK controls wrong PADS registers _ |
| Affects | RP2350 A2, QFN-60 package only |
| Description | RP2350 remaps IOs, their control registers and their ADC channels so that both package sizes appear to have consecutively numbered GPIOs, even though for physical design reasons the QFN-60 package bonds out a sparse selection of IO pads. The connection between the GPIO_NSMASK0/GPIO_NSMASK1 registers and the PADS registers doesn’t take this remapping into account. Consequently, in the QFN-60 package only, the GPIO NSMASK0 register bits _ are applied to registers for the wrong pads. Specifically, PADS BANK0 registers 29 through 0 are controlled _ by the concatenation of GPIO NSMASK bits 47 through 44, 39 through 33, 30 through 28, 24 through 17 and _ 15 through 8 (all inclusive ranges). This means that granting Non-secure access to the PADS registers in the QFN-60 package doesn’t allow Non-secure software to control the correct pads. It may also allow Non-secure control of pads that aren’t granted in GPIO NSMASK0. _ The QSPI PADS registers (Bank 1) aren’t affected because these aren’t remapped for different packages. |
| Workaround | Disable Non-secure access to the PADS registers by clearing PADS_BANK0.NSP, NSU. Implement a Secure Gateway (Arm) or ecall handler (RISC-V) to permit Non-Secure/U-mode code to read/write its assigned PADS BANK0 registers. _ |
