# 3.1. SIO

3.1. SIO

The Single-cycle IO subsystem (SIO) contains peripherals that require low-latency, deterministic access from the

processors. It is accessed via the AHB Fabric. The SIO has a dedicated bus interface for each processor, as shown in

Figure 7.

Figure 7. The single-

cycle IO block

contains registers

which processors

must access quickly.

FIFOs, doorbells and

spinlocks support

message passing and

synchronisation

between the two

cores. The shared

GPIO registers provide

fast, direct access to

GPIO-capable pins.

Interpolators can

accelerate common

software tasks. Most

SIO hardware is

banked (duplicated)

for Secure and Non-

secure access. Grey

arrows show bus

connections for Non-

secure access.

GPIO Registers (Shared S + NS)

The SIO contains:

• CPUID registers which read as 0/1 on core 0/1 (Section 3.1.2)
• Mailbox FIFOs for passing ordered messages between cores (Section 3.1.5)
• Doorbells for interrupting the opposite core on cumulative and unordered events (Section 3.1.6)
• Hardware spinlocks for implementing critical sections without using exclusive bus accesses (Section 3.1.4)
• Interpolators (Section 3.1.10) and TMDS encoders (Section 3.1.9)
• Standard RISC-V 64-bit platform timer (Section 3.1.8) which is usable by both Arm and RISC-V software
• GPIO registers for fast software bitbanging (Section 3.1.3), with shared access from both cores

Most SIO hardware is duplicated for Secure/Non-secure access. Non-secure access to the FIFO registers will see a

physically different FIFO than Secure access to the same address, so that messages belonging to Secure and Non-

secure software are not mixed: Section 3.1.1 describes this Secure/Non-secure banking in more detail.
