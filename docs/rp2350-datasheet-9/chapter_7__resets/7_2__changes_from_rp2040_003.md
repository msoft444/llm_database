# 7.2. Changes from RP2040

7.2. Changes from RP2040

RP2350 retains all RP2040 chip-level reset features.

RP2350 adds the following features:

• new chip reset sources:

◦glitch detector

◦watchdog

◦debugger
• new destinations:

◦new power management components

RP2350 makes the following modifications to existing features:

• Modified the CHIP_RESET register, which records the source of the last chip level reset. In RP2040, CHIP_RESET was

stored in the LDO_POR register block. In RP2350, CHIP_RESET was extended and moved to the POWMAN register block,

which is in the new always-on power domain (AON).
• Renamed the brownout reset (BOR) registers to brownout detect (BOD), added functionality, and moved them to the

new POWlMAN register block.
• Added more system reset stages. To support this, added additional Power-on State Machine fields and rearranged

the existing fields.
• Added additional RESETS registers and rearranged the existing fields.
• Extended watchdog options to enable triggers for new resets.

NOTE

Watchdog scratch registers are not preserved when the watchdog triggers a chip-level reset. However, watchdog

scratch registers are preserved after a system or subsystem reset. For general purpose scratch registers that do not

reset after a chip-level reset, see the POWMAN register block Section 6.4, “Power management (POWMAN) registers”.
