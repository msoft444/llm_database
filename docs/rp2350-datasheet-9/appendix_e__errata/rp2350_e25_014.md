# RP2350-E25

RP2350-E25

| Reference | RP2350-E25 |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | A LOAD_MAP that uses non-word sizes doesn’t cause an error. |
| Affects | RP2350 A2, RP2350 A3 |
| Description | Non-word sizes in a LOAD MAP aren’t supported and were documented as such. However, they don’t _ currently cause an error. Whilst non-word sizes might currently work in some certain cases, you should never use them because they might not work as you expect in all cases and can be properly treated as an error in the future. The SDK and picotool don’t generate such LOAD MAPs with non-word sized entries. _ |
| Workaround | Don’t use non-word (not multiple of 4) sizes in a LOAD MAP. A best practice is to make sure that linker _ memory segments are both word-sized and word-aligned. As of the RP2350 A4 bootrom, non-word sizes are detected when checking the LOAD MAP and cause the _ IMAGE DEF to be considered invalid if present. _ |
