| Summary | USB OTP VDD disruption can result in corrupt OTP row read data _ _ |
| Affects | RP2350 A2 |
| Description | The OTP array has a read voltage generated from USB OTP VDD using an internal linear regulator. While the _ _ regulator has a "power good" signal, it isn’t sampled outside of the initial power-on reset startup sequence. External manipulation of USB OTP VDD can result in incorrect data being latched during the array _ _ read phase. The erroneous behaviour includes, but isn’t limited to: • Latching the previous read cycle data from the array • One or many bitlines returning zeroes for programmed bits • Byte-shifted read data In the case of guarded reads, the first failure mode can result in the guard read check passing and the guard word also ending up as the read data. If the critical data are the CRIT0/CRIT1 flags, sampled by the OTP PSM during boot, this can enable Hazard3 debug and disable the Arm cores, which results in a reversion of the effects of the CRIT1.SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE and CRIT1.DEBUG_DISABLE flags. Guarded ECC reads aren’t typically vulnerable to corruption of this nature as the guard word is an invalid ECC word, and bit deletion or byte shifting reliably invalidates the ECC check. RP2350 A3 incorporates more safeguards against erroneous OTP behaviour. If any of the following checks fail, the chip is reset back to the start of the OTP PSM stage. • The OTP regulator OK signal is continuously checked whenever OTP PSM or user accesses are being performed. • Bit 0 of the row read address selects either the first or second ROM calibration word (0x333333 or 0xcccccc) for any guarded read, and is validated accordingly. • Reserved-0 bits in the CRIT0/1 rows are checked as reading 0 in the OTP PSM. These checks are performed regardless of the security state of the chip. The OTP regulator check may be masked with bit 2 of the AUXCTRL register. |
