RP2350-E22

| Reference | RP2350-E22 |

| Summary | Parsing a malformed "lollipop" block loop will cause a hang rather than a failure |
| Affects | RP2350 A2 |
| Description | PARTITION TABLEs and IMAGE DEFs metadata are stored as part of a block loop. These block loops are parsed _ _ during boot and at other times. A "lollipop" block loop is an invalid block loop, which loops back from the last block to a block, which isn’t the first. Such an invalid block loop is never generated by the SDK or by picotool; however, it could potentially be generated by other tooling. |
| Workaround | Don’t use "lollipop" block loops. If you program a "lollipop" block loop into flash such that it’s read during the boot process, it will cause a boot hang and also a hang on entry into BOOTSEL mode. Therefore, to re- enable booting, you must clear the flash in some other way, for example, from the debugger over SWD. |
