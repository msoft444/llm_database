# 10.3. Overview (RISC-V)

10.3. Overview (RISC-V)

The RP2350 bootrom does not implement secure boot for RISC-V processors. Secure flash boot can still be

implemented on RISC-V by storing secure boot code in OTP and disabling other boot media via the BOOT_FLAGS0 row

in OTP. However, this is not supported natively by the RP2350 bootrom.

The RISC-V processors on RP2350 implement Machine and User execution modes, and the standard Physical Memory

Protection unit (PMP), which can be used to enforce internal security or safety boundaries. See Section 10.4.

Non-processor-specific hardware security features, such as debug disable OTP flags and the glitch detectors, are

functionally identically between Arm and RISC-V. However, the redundancy coprocessor (RCP) is not accessible from

the RISC-V processors, as it uses a Cortex-M33-specific coprocessor interface.
