| Offset | Name | Info |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x00 | LOCK | Once a LOCK bit is written to 1, ACCESSCTRL silently ignores writes from that master. LOCK is writable only by a Secure, Privileged processor or debugger. LOCK bits are only writable when their value is zero. Once set, they can never be cleared, except by a full reset of ACCESSCTRL Setting the LOCK bit does not affect whether an access raises a bus error. Unprivileged writes, or writes from the DMA, will continue to raise bus errors. All other accesses will continue not to. |
| 0x04 | FORCE_CORE_NS | Force core 1’s bus accesses to always be Non-secure, no matter the core’s internal state. Useful for schemes where one core is designated as the Non- secure core, since some peripherals may filter individual registers internally based on security state but not on master ID. |
| 0x08 | CFGRESET | Write 1 to reset all ACCESSCTRL configuration, except for the LOCK and FORCE_CORE_NS registers. This bit is used in the RP2350 bootrom to quickly restore ACCESSCTRL to a known state during the boot path. Note that, like all registers in ACCESSCTRL, this register is not writable when the writer’s corresponding LOCK bit is set, therefore a master which has been locked out of ACCESSCTRL can not use the CFGRESET register to disturb its contents. |

ACCESSCTRL: LOCK Register

Offset: 0x00

Description

Once a LOCK bit is written to 1, ACCESSCTRL silently ignores writes from that master. LOCK is writable only by a

Secure, Privileged processor or debugger.

LOCK bits are only writable when their value is zero. Once set, they can never be cleared, except by a full reset of

ACCESSCTRL

Setting the LOCK bit does not affect whether an access raises a bus error. Unprivileged writes, or writes from the DMA,

will continue to raise bus errors. All other accesses will continue not to.

*Table 912. LOCK ACCESSCTRL: FORCE_CORE_NS Register Offset: 0x04 Description*

Force core 1’s bus accesses to always be Non-secure, no matter the core’s internal state.

Useful for schemes where one core is designated as the Non-secure core, since some peripherals may filter individual

registers internally based on security state but not on master ID.

This bit is used in the RP2350 bootrom to quickly restore ACCESSCTRL to a known state during the boot path. Note that, like all registers in ACCESSCTRL, this register is not writable when the writer’s corresponding LOCK bit is set, therefore a master which has been locked out of ACCESSCTRL can not use the CFGRESET register to disturb its contents. | SC | 0x0 |
