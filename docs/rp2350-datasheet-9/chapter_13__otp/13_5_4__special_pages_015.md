# 13.5.4. Special pages

13.5.4. Special pages

The following pages require special case handling in their lock checks:

• The lock word region itself (pages 62 and 63)

◦Lock words are always world-readable

◦Lock words are writable by Secure code if the lock word itself permits Secure writes

◦Consequently, lock words 62 and 63 are considered "spare", since they do not protect pages 62 and 63; the

page 63 lock word is repurposed for the RMA flag
• The hardware access key page (page 61)

◦Contains OTP access keys and debug access keys

◦Each key also has a valid bit (rbit)

◦Page 61 (key page) has all of the usual protections from the page 61 lock word

◦If a key’s valid bit is set, that key is inaccessible; the converse is not necessarily true

Page 0, known as the chip info page, is not a special page. Raspberry Pi sets page 0 to read-only during factory test,

after writing chip identification and calibration values.
