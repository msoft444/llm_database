# 13.6.2. Modified Hamming ECC

13.6.2. Modified Hamming ECC

ECC generates six parity bits based on the data value stored in bits 15:0 of an OTP row. When programming a row, ECC

generates those six parity bits and includes them in the target value as bits 21:16. This code consists of:

• A 5-bit Hamming code that identifies single-bit errors
• An even parity bit which allows two-bit errors to be detected in the Hamming code and the original 16-bit data

When you read an OTP value through an ECC alias (Section 13.1), ECC recalculates the six parity bits based on the value

read from the OTP row. Then, ECC XORs the original six parity bits with the newly-calculated parity bits. This generates

6 new bits:

• the 5 LSBs are the syndrome, a unique bit pattern that corresponds to each possible bit flip in the data value
• the MSB distinguishes between odd and even numbers of bit flips

If all 6 bits in this value are zero, ECC did not detect an error. If the MSB is 1, the syndrome should indicate a single-bit

error. ECC flips the corresponding data bit to recover from the error. If the MSB is 0, but the syndrome contains a value

other than 0, the ECC detected an unrecoverable multi-bit error.

You can calculate 5-bit Hamming codes and parity bits with the following C code (adapted from the RP2350 bootrom

source):

```c
uint32_t even_parity(uint32_t input) {
    uint32_t rc = 0;
    while (input) {
        rc ^= input & 1;
        input >>= 1;
    }
    return rc;
}
const uint32_t otp_ecc_parity_table[6] = {
    0b0000001010110101011011,
    0b0000000011011001101101,
    0b0000001100011110001110,
    0b0000000000011111110000,
    0b0000001111100000000000,
    0b0111111111111111111111
};
uint32_t s_otp_calculate_ecc(uint16_t x) {
    uint32_t p = x;
    for (uint i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
        p |= even_parity(p & otp_ecc_parity_table[i]) << (16 + i);
    }
    return p;
```
