# 13.6.1. Bit repair by polarity (BRP)

13.6.1. Bit repair by polarity (BRP)

Bit repair by polarity (BRP) compensates for a single bit present at time of programming.

When programming a row, hardware or software first calculates a 24-bit target value consisting of:

• Two zeroes in bits 23:22
• 6-bit Hamming ECC in bits 21:16
• 16-bit data value in bits 15:0

Before programming, an OTP row should contain all zeros. However, sometimes OTP rows contain a single bit that is

already set to 1, either due to manufacturing flaws or previous programming. If a bit is already set (1) in an OTP row

before programming, BRP checks the status of the corresponding bit in the target value. BRP compensates for this

single set bit in one of two ways, depending on the corresponding value in the target value:

• If the bit is clear (0), BRP inverts the target row and writes two ones in bits 23:22.
• If the bit is set (1), BRP does not invert the target row, leaving two zeroes in bits 23:22.

When you read an OTP value through an ECC alias (Section 13.1), BRP checks for two ones in bits 23:22. When both bits

23 and 22 are set, BRP inverts the entire row before passing it to the modified Hamming code stage.

BRP makes it possible to store any 22-bit value in a row that initially has at most one bit set, preserving the correction

margin of the modified Hamming code. During manufacturing test, hardware scans the entire OTP array to ensure no

rows contain more than one pre-set bit.
