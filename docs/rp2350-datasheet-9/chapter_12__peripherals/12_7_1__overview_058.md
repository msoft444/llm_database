# 12.7.1. Overview

12.7.1. Overview

NOTE

Prerequisite knowledge required

This section requires knowledge of the USB protocol. If you aren’t yet familiar with the USB protocol, we recommend

the archive of the very useful USB Made Simple website. For formal definitions of the terminology used in this

section, see the USB 2.0 Specification.

RP2350 contains a USB 2.0 controller that can operate as either:

• a Full Speed (FS) device (12 Mb/s)
• a host that can communicate with both Low Speed (LS) (1.5 Mb/s) and Full Speed devices, including multiple

downstream devices connected to a USB hub

There is an integrated USB 1.1 PHY which interfaces the USB controller with the DP and DM pins of the chip. You may use

this as 3.3 V GPIO when the USB controller is not in use.

RP2350 Datasheet

12.7.1.1. Features

The USB controller hardware handles the low level USB protocol. The programmer must configure the controller, provide

data buffers, and consume or provide data buffers in response to events on the bus. The controller interrupts the

processor when it needs attention. The USB controller has 4 kB of dual-port SRAM (DPSRAM) used for configuration

and data buffers.

12.7.1.1.1. Device Mode

In Device Mode, the USB controller has the following characteristics:

• USB 2.0-compatible Full Speed device (12 Mb/s)
• Supports up to 32 endpoints (Endpoints 0 → 15 in both in and out directions)
• Supports Control, Isochronous (ISO), Bulk, and Interrupt endpoint types
• Supports double buffering
• 3840 bytes of usable buffer space in DPSRAM. This is equivalent to 60 × 64-byte buffers

12.7.1.1.2. Host Mode

In Host Mode, the USB controller can:

• communicate with Full Speed (12 Mb/s) devices and Low Speed devices (1.5 Mb/s)
• communicate with multiple devices via a USB hub, including Low Speed devices connected to a Full Speed hub
• poll up to 15 interrupt endpoints in hardware (used by hubs to notify the host of connect/disconnect events, used

by mice to notify the host of movement, etc.)

12.7.1.1.3. USB DPRAM

The USB controller uses 4 kB of dual-port SRAM (DPSRAM) to exchange data and control information with the

controller. This is also referred to as dual-port RAM (DPRAM). One port is accessible from the system bus, clocked by

clk_sys. The other port is accessible from the controller, clocked by clk_usb. The DPRAM is mapped in the system

address space starting from 0x50100000, USBCTRL_DPRAM_BASE.

The USB DPRAM supports 32-bit, 16-bit and 8-bit reads and writes. Writes complete in one cycle. Reads complete in two

cycles.

You can store general user data in USB DPRAM space not required for USB controller operation. When the controller is

disabled, all 4 kB of DPRAM is available. Before accessing the DPRAM, you must take the USB controller out of reset.

Since the USB controller is in the peripheral address space, it is not accessible for processor instruction fetch.

Attempting to fetch instructions from USB DPRAM unconditionally returns a bus error response, no matter the

configuration of the processor SAU/MPU/PMP or the system ACCESSCTRL registers.

As peripheral addresses are marked Exempt in the IDAU (Section 10.2.2), the SAU configuration for this address range

is ignored. Accesses to USB DPRAM are controlled only by the processor MPU/PMP and the ACCESSCTRL USBCTRL

register.
