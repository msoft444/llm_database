12.15.1. SYSINFO

12.15.1.1. Overview

The sysinfo block contains system information. The first register contains the Chip ID, which allows the programmer to

know which version of the chip software is running on. The second register indicates which package configuration is

used (QFN-60 or QFN-80). The third register will always read as 1.

12.15.1.2. List of registers

The sysinfo registers start at a base address of 0x40000000 (defined as SYSINFO_BASE in SDK).

| Offset | Name | Info |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x00 | CHIP_ID | JEDEC JEP-106 compliant chip identifier. |
| 0x04 | PACKAGE_SEL | Package selection indicator, 0 = QFN80, 1 = QFN60 |
| 0x08 | PLATFORM | Platform register. Allows software to know what environment it is running in during pre-production development. Post- production, the PLATFORM is always ASIC, non-SIM. |
| 0x14 | GITREF_RP2350 | Git hash of the chip source. Used to identify chip version. |
