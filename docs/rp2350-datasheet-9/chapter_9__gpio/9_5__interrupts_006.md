# 9.5. Interrupts

9.5. Interrupts

An interrupt can be generated for every GPIO pin in four scenarios:

• Level High: the GPIO pin is a logical 1
• Level Low: the GPIO pin is a logical 0
• Edge High: the GPIO has transitioned from a logical 0 to a logical 1
• Edge Low: the GPIO has transitioned from a logical 1 to a logical 0

The level interrupts are not latched. This means that if the pin is a logical 1 and the level high interrupt is active, it will

become inactive as soon as the pin changes to a logical 0. The edge interrupts are stored in the INTR register and can be

cleared by writing to the INTR register.

There are enable, status, and force registers for three interrupt destinations: proc 0, proc 1, and dormant_wake. For proc

0 the registers are enable (PROC0_INTE0), status (PROC0_INTS0), and force (PROC0_INTF0). Dormant wake is used to

wake the ROSC or XOSC up from dormant mode. See Section 6.5.6.2 for more information on dormant mode.

There is an interrupt output for each combination of IO bank, IRQ destination, and security domain. In total there are

twelve such outputs:

• IO Bank 0 to dormant wake (Secure and Non-secure)
• IO Bank 0 to proc 0 (Secure and Non-secure)
• IO Bank 0 to proc 1 (Secure and Non-secure)
• IO QSPI to dormant wake (Secure and Non-secure)
• IO QSPI to proc 0 (Secure and Non-secure)
• IO QSPI to proc 1 (Secure and Non-secure)

Each interrupt output has its own array of enable registers (INTE) that configures which GPIO events cause the interrupt

to assert. The interrupt asserts when at least one enabled event occurs, and de-asserts when all enabled events have

been acknowledged via the relevant INTR register.

This means the user can watch for several GPIO events at once.

Summary registers can be used to quickly check for pending GPIO interrupts. See IRQSUMMARY_PROC0_NONSECURE0

for an example.
