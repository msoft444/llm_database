# 3.6.2. Double-precision coprocessor (DCP)

3.6.2. Double-precision coprocessor (DCP)

Each Cortex-M33 CPU core is equipped with two instances of a double-precision coprocessor that provides acceleration

of double-precision floating point operations including add, subtract, multiply, divide and square root. The design is

implemented in just a few thousand gates and so occupies much less silicon die area than a full double-precision

floating-point unit.

Nevertheless, these coprocessors considerably speed up basic double-precision operations compared to pure software

implementations. The coprocessors also offer support for some single-precision operations and conversions.

The two coprocessor instances are assigned to the Secure and Non-secure domains. Coprocessor number 4 always

maps to the coprocessor used for the current processor security state. Coprocessor number 5 always maps to the Non-

secure coprocessor instance, but is accessible only from Secure code. This duplication avoids saving and restoring the

coprocessor context during Secure/Non-secure state transitions.

3.6.2.1. CPU interface

As with the other coprocessors, the accelerator connects to the CPU over a 64-bit bus. Two words of data can be

transferred per cycle over that bus using the following instructions:

• MCRR: move two integer registers to coprocessor
• MRRC: move two integer registers from coprocessor

There are also single-register versions of these instructions, including ones that allow the CPU’s flags to be loaded from

the coprocessor. The CPU issues CDP instructions to trigger operations within the coprocessor without transferring any

data.

3.6.2.2. Internal architecture

A block diagram of the accelerator is shown in Figure 12.

*Figure 12. Block diagram of double- precision accelerator At the heart of the design are:*

• two sets of registers, each designed to hold an unpacked double-precision value
• a 9-bit status register

Unlike a conventional FPU, the accelerator does not contain a full register bank. Not only does this save die area, it also

means that saving and restoring the coprocessor’s state is very fast: in fact, the entire state fits within six 32-bit words

and hence can be saved to, or restored from, the CPU in three instructions.

The accelerator contains a wide adder, capable of adding two mantissa values and three exponent values

simultaneously. There is also a shifter that can either perform a logical right shift by a given amount, or normalise a

denormalised mantissa and report the amount of shift required to do so. A considerable amount of hardware in the

shifter is shared between these two operating modes.

Control logic, shown at the top of the diagram, decodes coprocessor instructions and configures the accelerator’s

functional units and datapath multiplexers in order to execute the desired operation. Each coprocessor instruction takes

a single cycle, so coprocessor operations cannot stall the CPU.

A floating-point operation such as addition or subtraction is carried out by executing a fixed (or 'canned') sequence of

instructions as follows:

1. One or two MCRR instructions to write the operands to the coprocessor.

2. A number of CDP (and possibly other) instructions that together perform the operation itself.

3. An MRRC or MRC instruction to read back the result.

The hardware handles special cases involving zeroes, NaNs, and infinities, as well as rounding, underflow and overflow.

3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors
105

RP2350 Datasheet

The accelerator does not contain a multiplier array, as that would occupy a considerable amount of die area. Instead,

the mantissas of the operands of a multiplication operation are brought back into the CPU to take advantage of the fast

long multiply instructions available there. The coprocessor handles the processing of exponents.

Division and square root operations also involve data moving back and forth between coprocessor and CPU. To assist

with these operations, the coprocessor contains two small lookup tables (implemented as random logic) that provide

initial approximations used in the divide and square root algorithms. The coprocessor handles the processing of

exponents.

The accelerator is only meant to be used with the canned instruction sequences that implement basic floating-point

operations. The state of the accelerator is not guaranteed to be preserved from the end of one canned sequence to the

beginning of the next: see the discussion of the 'engaged' flag in the status register below.

3.6.2.3. Registers

X and Y mantissa registers

The X and Y mantissa registers (xm and ym) are each 64 bits wide. They can be read and written directly by the CPU;

the xm register can also store the lower part of the result from the adder. When a value is written to the coprocessor

using a 'write unpacked' MCRR instruction, the top two bits of the mantissa register are set to 01 and the next most

significant bits are filled from the mantissa field of the floating-point operand. The low-order bits of the mantissa

register are cleared.

X and Y exponent registers

The X and Y exponent registers (xe and ye) are each 14 bits wide. They can be read and written directly by the CPU;

the xe register can also store the higher part of the result from the adder. When a value is written to the coprocessor

using a 'write unpacked' MCRR instruction, the exponent register is set from the exponent field of the floating-point

operand.

X and Y flag registers

The X and Y flag registers (xf and yf) are each four bits wide. They can be read and written directly by the CPU. The

flag register stores information about the type of floating-point number represented in the corresponding mantissa

and exponent registers: its sign, whether it is a zero, whether it is an infinity, and whether it is a NaN. When a value

is written to the coprocessor using a 'write unpacked' MCRR instruction, the bits of the flag register are updated

according to the type of the floating-point operand.

Status register

The status register contains nine bits. It can be read and written directly by the CPU. The least significant six bits of

the register store the shift required to align the two operands of an addition or subtraction; the next two bits

indicate whether the value represented by (xe, xm) is greater than, equal to, or less than the value represented by

(ye, ym) - in other words, whether the magnitude of the value stored in the X registers is greater than, equal to, or

less than the magnitude of the value stored in the Y registers. These status bits are set in the first step of an

addition, subtraction or comparison operation after the operands have been loaded.

The final bit of the status register indicates whether the coprocessor is 'engaged'. The engaged flag is set by all

coprocessor instructions that occur at the beginning or in the middle of the canned instruction sequences. It is cleared

by those instructions used at the end of a canned sequence to read back a final result.

3.6.2.4. State save and restore

An interrupt handler can test the engaged flag to determine whether it has pre-empted an in-progress operation on the

same coprocessor. If the engaged flag is set, the handler can save (and restore) the coprocessor state before using the

coprocessor. If the engaged flag is clear, the save (and restore) step can be skipped. If this approach is implemented,

the state of the accelerator must be regarded as undefined when not within one of the canned instruction sequences.

Three MRRC instructions are provided to copy the six words of state in the coprocessor into integer registers in the CPU,

from where they can, for example, be pushed onto the stack. The last of these instructions clears the engaged flag.

3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors

RP2350 Datasheet

Similarly, three MCRR instructions are provided to restore the state of the coprocessor from integer registers, including the

state of the engaged flag.

3.6.2.5. Instruction summary

As mentioned above, it is intended that the coprocessor instructions are only used as part of canned sequences.

Nevertheless, for completeness, a list of the available instructions is given here with an outline of their effects.

*Table 111. MRRC and*

3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors

RP2350 Datasheet

Alongside each MRRC and MRC instruction is a variant starting P (for 'peek') instead of R that has the same function but

preserves the engaged flag. RXMD is identical to PXMD; REFD is identical to PEFD.

The SDK includes macros to generate Arm assembler from the mnemonics above in the file dcp_instr.inc.S in the SDK,

for example turning WXUP r0,r1 into mcrr p4,#1,r0,r1,c0.

3.6.2.6. Example canned sequence

The assembly code sequence to implement a callable double-precision addition operation is shown in Table 112.

| Arm assembler | Coprocessor mnemonic | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mcrr p4,#1,r0,r1,c0 | WXUP r0,r1 | write R0 and R1 unpacked double-precision into X |
| mcrr p4,#1,r2,r3,c1 | WYUP r2,r3 | write R2 and R3 unpacked double-precision into Y |
| cdp p4,#0,c0,c0,c1,#0 | ADD0 | compare X and Y; set status and alignment shift |
| cdp p4,#1,c0,c0,c1,#0 | ADD1 | add/subtract (depending on status and signs) xm and ym aligned, write result to xm |
| cdp p4,#8,c0,c0,c0,#1 | NRDD | normalise and round double-precision result |
| mrrc p4,#1,r0,r1,c0 | RDDA r0,r1 | read R0 and R1 packed double-precision from X, including special-value processing for addition |
| bx r14 |  | return from function |

*Table 112. Assembly code sequence to implement a callable double-precision addition operation*

Logic in the coprocessor ensures, for example, that the ADD1 instruction shifts the smaller argument, that xm and ym are

negated as required before being sent to the adder, and that the larger exponent is used as the basis for the subsequent

normalisation.

3.6.2.7. Using the coprocessor via the SDK library

The SDK pico_double library automatically uses the coprocessor for double-precision floating-point calculations. This is

the simplest way to take advantage of the coprocessor, but it entails a few cycles of overhead for each operation. Not

only is there the overhead involved in a function call and return, but for safety the general-purpose implementations in

the SDK always test the engaged flag, saving and restoring the coprocessor state to and from the stack as needed. That

ensures that the functions work correctly if used in interrupt handlers, without additional intervention.

3.6.2.8. Using the coprocessor directly

The SDK includes macros to generate canned sequences for standard operations in the file dcp_canned.inc.S in the SDK.

These allow the callable double-precision addition operation listed above, for example, to be written as:

```c
dcp_dadd_m r0,r1, r0,r1,r2,r3  @ result in r0,r1; operands in r0,r1 and r2,r3
bx r14
```

3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors
109

RP2350 Datasheet

dcp_dadd_m is a macro which expands into the sequence of coprocessor instructions given above. This macro allows you

to specify the integer registers to be used for the operands and the result, which means that using these macros directly

not only avoids function call and return overhead, it also avoids the extra overhead associated with argument

marshalling.

The more complex macros also require you to specify 'scratch' registers that they can use for storing intermediate

results. The following function, which calculates the dot product of two three-element vectors of doubles pointed to by

R0 and R1, illustrates this:

```c
push {r4-r9,r14}
ldrd r3,r4,[r0],#8                                     @ load x₀
ldrd r5,r6,[r1],#8                                     @ load y₀
dcp_dmul_m r7,r8, r3,r4,r5,r6, r3,r4,r5,r6,r12,r14,r9  @ compute x₀y₀ ①
ldrd r3,r4,[r0],#8                                     @ load x₁
ldrd r5,r6,[r1],#8                                     @ load y₁
dcp_dmul_m r3,r4, r3,r4,r5,r6, r3,r4,r5,r6,r12,r14,r9  @ compute x₁y₁ ①
dcp_dadd_m r7,r8, r3,r4,r7,r8                          @ compute x₀y₀+x₁y₁
ldrd r3,r4,[r0],#8                                     @ load x₂
ldrd r5,r6,[r1],#8                                     @ load y₂
dcp_dmul_m r3,r4, r3,r4,r5,r6, r3,r4,r5,r6,r12,r14,r9  @ compute x₂y₂ ①
dcp_dadd_m r0,r1, r3,r4,r7,r8                          @ compute x₀y₀+x₁y₁+x₂y₂ ②
pop {r4-r9,r15}
```

1. r3, r4, r5, r6, r12, r14, and r9 are scratch registers.

2. stores the result in r0, r1.

NOTE

This example does not check the engaged flag. If used in interrupt handlers or in multi-threaded applications, a

suitable test would have to be added. For example, see the SDK implementation of __aeabi_dadd for an efficient way

to do this. The test only needs to be performed once, at the beginning of the function, so the overhead in this case

would be relatively small.

The following example demonstrates how to use the coprocessor:

3.6.2.9. IEEE 754 compliance

The canned instruction sequences provide IEEE-compliant operations with the exception that denormals are flushed to

zero on input and output. Zeroes, NaNs and infinities are correctly handled. Rounding is to nearest, even on tie.

Faster versions of division and square root operations, named ddiv_fast and dsqrt_fast respectively, are available. These

do not always give correctly rounded results but do have a guaranteed error before rounding of less than 0.5ulp ('units in

last place'), which in particular means that if there is an exact representation of the result then that is what is returned.

3.6.2.10. Benchmarks

Table 113 gives cycle counts for various floating-point operations using the accelerator with inlined code, compared to

some typical ranges of benchmarks for (a) fully-fledged hardware double-precision FPUs; and (b) pure software

implementations.
