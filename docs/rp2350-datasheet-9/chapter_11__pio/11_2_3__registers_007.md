# 11.2.3. Registers

11.2.3. Registers

Each state machine possesses a small number of internal registers. These hold input or output data, and temporary

values such as loop counter variables.

11.2.3.1. Output Shift Register (OSR)

*Figure 46. Output Shift Register (OSR). Data is parcelled out 1…32 bits at a time, and unused data is recycled by a bidirectional shifter.*

The Output Shift Register (OSR) holds and shifts output data between the TX FIFO and the pins or other destinations,

Once empty, the OSR

is reloaded from the

such as the scratch registers.

TX FIFO.

• PULL instructions: remove a 32-bit word from the TX FIFO and place into the OSR.
• OUT instructions shift data from the OSR to other destinations, 1…32 bits at a time.
• The OSR fills with zeroes as data is shifted out
• The state machine will automatically refill the OSR from the FIFO on an OUT instruction, once some total shift count

threshold is reached, if autopull is enabled
• Shift direction can be left/right, configurable by the processor via configuration registers

For example, to stream data through the FIFO and output to the pins at a rate of one byte per two clocks:

```c
1 .program pull_example1
2 loop:
3     out pins, 8
4 public entry_point:
5     pull
6     out pins, 8 [1]
7     out pins, 8 [1]
8     out pins, 8
9     jmp loop
```
