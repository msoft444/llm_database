# 5.9.2. Common block items

5.9.2. Common block items

The following items might appear in a IMAGE_DEF or a PARTITION_TABLE block.

5.9.2.1. VERSION item

A major/minor version number for the binary, 32 bits total, plus optionally a 16-bit rollback version and a list of OTP

rows which can be read to determine the (thermometer-coded) minimum major rollback version which this device will

allow to be installed. The major and minor are always present, whereas the rollback version and OTP row list are

generally only included if rollback protection is required.

NOTE

The rollback version and OTP row list are only valid for IMAGE_DEFs, and are ignored on a RP2350 that hasn’t been

secured.

If the number of OTP row entries is zero, there is no rollback version for this block.

| Word | Bytes | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 | 0x48 (size_flag == 0, item_type == PICOBIN BLOCK ITEM 1BS VERSION) _ _ _ _ |
|  | 1 | 2 + ((num otp row entries != 0) + num row entries + 1) / 2 _ _ _ _ _ |
|  | 1 | 0x00 (pad) |
|  | 1 | num_otp_row_entries |
| 1 | 2 | Minor Version |
|  | 2 | Major Version |
| (2) | (2) | Rollback version (if num_otp_entries != 0) |
|  | (2) | First 16-bit OTP Row index (if num_otp_entries != 0`) |
| … | … | Remaining 16-OTP Row indexes (padded with a zero to make a word boundary if necessary) |

Each OTP row entry indicates the row number (1 through 4095 inclusive) of the first in a group of 3 OTP rows. The three

OTP rows are each read as a 24 bit raw value, combined via a bitwise majority vote, and then the index of the most-

significant 1 bit determines the version number. So, a single group of three rows can encode rollback versions from 0 to

23 inclusive, or, when all 24 bits are set, an indeterminate version of at least 24. Each additional OTP row index indicates

a further group of 3 rows that increases the maximum version by 24.

There is no requirement for different OTP row entries to be contiguous in OTP. They should not overlap, though the

bootrom doesn’t need to check this (the boot signing tool may).

NOTE

For this entry to be considered valid, the number of available bits in the indicated OTP rows must be strictly greater

than the rollback version. This means that it is always possible to determine that the device’s minimum rollback

version is greater than the rollback version indicated in this block, even if we don’t know the full list of OTP rows

used by later major versions.

The major/minor version are used to disambiguate which is newer out of two binaries with the same major rollback

version. For example, to select which A/B image to boot from. when no major rollback version is specified, A/B

comparisons will treat the missing major version as zero, but no rollback check will be performed.

5.9.2.2. HASH_DEF item

Optional item with information about what how to hash:

| Word | Bytes | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 | 0x47 (size_flag == 0, item_type == PICOBIN BLOCK ITEM 1BS HASH DEF) _ _ _ _ _ |
|  | 1 | 0x03 (size_lo) |
|  | 1 | 0x00 (pad) |
|  | 1 | 0x01 (PICOBIN HASH SHA-256) _ _ |
| 1 | 2 | Number of words of block hashed (not including HEADER word at the start of the block) |
|  | 2 | 0x0000 (pad) |

block_words_hashed must include this item if using this item for a signature.

The most recent LOAD_MAP item (see Section 5.9.3.2) that defines what to hash.

5.9.2.3. HASH_VALUE item

Optional item containing a hash value that can be used by the bootrom to verify the hash of an image or partition table

when not using signatures.

| Word | Bytes | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 | 0x09 (size_flag == 0, item_type == PICOBIN BLOCK ITEM HASH VALUE) _ _ _ _ |
|  | 1 | 0x01 + n where n is the number of hash words included (1-8) |
|  | 2 | 0x0000 (pad) |
| 1 | 4 | Hash Value (lowest significant 32 bits) |
| … | … | … |
| n | 4 | Hash Value (highest significant 32 bits) |

TIP

Whilst a SHA-256 hash is 8 words, you can include fewer (down to 1 word) to save space if you like, and only that

many words will be compared against the full 8-word hash at runtime.

This HASH_VALUE item is paired with the most recent HASH_DEF item (Section 5.9.2.2) which defines what is being hashed.

5.9.2.4. SIGNATURE item

Optional item containing cryptographic signature that can be used by the bootrom to signature check the hashed

contents of an image or partition table.

| Word | Bytes | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 | 0x4b (size_flag == 0, item_type == PICOBIN BLOCK ITEM SIGNATURE) _ _ _ |
|  | 1 | 0x21 (Block size in words) |
|  | 1 | 0x00 (pad) |
|  | 1 | 0x01 (PICOBIN SIGNATURE SECP256K1) _ _ |
| 1 | 4 | Public Key (lowest significant 32 bits) |
| … | … | … |
| 16 | 4 | Public Key (highest significant 32 bits) |
| 17 | 4 | Signature of hash (lowest significant 32 bits) |
| … | … | … |
| 32 | 4 | Signature of hash (highest significant 32 bits) |

This SIGNATURE item is paired with the most recent HASH_DEF item (Section 5.9.2.2) which defines what the hash value

whose signature is checked.
