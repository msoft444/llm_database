# 5.1.12. Flash image boot

5.1.12. Flash image boot

RP2350 is designed primarily to run code from a QSPI flash device, either in-package or soldered separately to the

circuit board. Code runs either in-place in flash, or in SRAM after being loaded from flash. Flash boot is the process of

discovering that code and preparing to run it. Flash image boot uses a program binary stored directly in flash rather

than in a flash partition. Flash image boot requires the bootrom to discover a block loop starting within the first 4 kB of

flash which contains a valid IMAGE_DEF (and no PARTITION_TABLE).

RP2350 Datasheet

Flash image boot has no partition table, so it cannot be used with A/B version checking, which requires separate A/B

partitions. The IMAGE_DEF will boot if it is valid (which includes requiring a signature on a secured RP2350).

For the non-signed case, the IMAGE_DEF can be as small as a 20-bytes; see Section 5.9.5.


TIP

A more complicated version of this scenario stores multiple IMAGE_DEFs in the block loop. In this case, the last

IMAGE_DEF for the current architecture is booted, if valid. You can use this to implement universal binaries for various

supported architectures, or to include multiple signatures for targeting devices with different keys.
