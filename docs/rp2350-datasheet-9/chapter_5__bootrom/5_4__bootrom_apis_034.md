# 5.4. Bootrom APIs

5.4. Bootrom APIs

Whilst some ROM space is dedicated to the implementation of the boot sequence and USB/UART boot interfaces, the

bootrom also contains public functions that provide useful RP2350 functionality that may be useful for any code or

runtime running on the device.

A categorised list is available in Section 5.4.6.

The full alphabetical list is available in Section 5.4.7.
