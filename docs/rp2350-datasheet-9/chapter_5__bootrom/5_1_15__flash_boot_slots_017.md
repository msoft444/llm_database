# 5.1.15. Flash boot slots

5.1.15. Flash boot slots

The previous sections within this chapter discuss block loops starting within the first 4 kB of flash. Such a block loop

contained either an IMAGE_DEF, a partition table (searched for IMAGE_DEFs), or an IMAGE_DEF and a PARTITION_TABLE (not

searched).

All the previously mentioned cases discovered their block loop in slot 0. Under certain circumstances, the neighbouring

slot 1 is also searched.

Slot 0 starts at the beginning of flash, and has a size of n × 4 kB sectors. Slot 1 has the same size and follows

immediately after slot 0. The value of n defaults to 1. Both slots are 4 kB in size, but you can override this value by

specifying 
a 
value 
in 
FLASH_PARTITION_SLOT_SIZE 
and 
then 
setting

BOOT_FLAGS0.OVERRIDE_FLASH_PARTITION_SLOT_SIZE.

Similarly to how a choice can be made between IMAGE_DEFs in A/B partitions, a choice can be made between A/B

PARTITION_TABLEs via the two boot slots. This allows for versioning partition tables, targeted drag and drop of UF2s

(Section 5.1.18) containing partition tables, etc. similar to the process used for images.

Slot 1 is only of use when potentially using partition tables. In the simple case of an IMAGE_DEF and no PARTITION_TABLE

found in a block loop starting in slot 0, that image likely actually overlays the space where slot 1 would be, but in any

case, slot 1 is ignored since there is no PARTITION_TABLE.

If slot 0 contains a PARTITION_TABLE or does not contain an IMAGE_DEF (including nothing/garbage in slot 0), slot 1 can be

considered. As an optimisation, in the former case, the scanning of slot 1 can be prevented by setting the singleton flag

in the PARTITION_TABLE.

NOTE

When IMAGE_DEFs are also present in the slots, the PARTITION_TABLE's VERSION item determines which of slot 0 and slot 1

to use. The IMAGE_DEF metadata is ignored for the purpose of version comparison.
