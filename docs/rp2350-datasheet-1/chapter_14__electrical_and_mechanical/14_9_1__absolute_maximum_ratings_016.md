14.9. Electrical specifications
The following electrical specifications are obtained from characterisation over the specified temperature and voltage
ranges, as well as process variation, unless the specification is marked as 'Simulated'. In this case, the data is for
information purposes only, and is not guaranteed.
14.9.1. Absolute maximum ratings
Stresses beyond the absolute maximum ratings listed in the following table can cause permanent damage to the
device. These are stress ratings only and do not refer to the functional operation of the device.
