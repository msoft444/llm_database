# 12.5.2. Programmer’s model

12.5.1. Overview
Pulse width modulation (PWM) smoothly varies the average voltage of a digital signal using controlled-width positive
pulses at regular intervals. The fraction of time spent high is known as the duty cycle. This may be used to approximate
an analogue output or control switchmode power electronics.
The RP2350 PWM block has 12 identical slices. Each slice can drive two PWM output signals, or measure the frequency
or duty cycle of an input signal. The two outputs on each slice have the same period, but independently varying duty
cycles, so this gives a total of 24 controllable PWM outputs in the QFN-80 package.
Figure 111. A single
PWM slice. A 16-bit
counter counts from 0
up to some
programmed value,
and then wraps to
zero, or counts back
down again,
depending on PWM
mode. The A and B
outputs transition high
and low based on the
current count value
and the
preprogrammed A and
B thresholds. The
counter advances
based on a number of
events: it may be free-
running, or gated by
level or edge of an
input signal on the B
pin. A fractional
divider slows the
overall count rate for
finer control of output
frequency.
Each PWM slice is equipped with the following:
• 16-bit counter
• 8.4 fractional clock divider
• Two independent output channels, duty cycle from 0% to 100% inclusive
• Dual slope and trailing edge modulation
• Edge-sensitive input mode for frequency measurement
• Level-sensitive input mode for duty cycle measurement
• Configurable counter wrap value
◦Wrap and level registers are double buffered and can be changed race-free while PWM is running
• Interrupt request and DMA request on counter wrap
• Phase can be precisely advanced or retarded while running (increments of one count)
Slices can be enabled or disabled simultaneously via a single global control register. Slices then run in lockstep, so that
more complex power circuitry can be switched by the outputs of multiple slices.
12.5.1.1. Changes from RP2040
• Increased the number of slices from 8 to 12, with the 4 additional slices available on GPIOs 32 through 47 in the
QFN-80 package.
• Added a second shared interrupt line (controlled by IRQ1_INTE), to aid use of PWM slices as simple repeating
timers.
12.5.2. Programmer’s model
All GPIO pins on RP2350 can be used for PWM:

• The first 16 PWM channels (8 × 2-channel slices) appear on GPIOs 0 through 15, in the order PWM0 A, PWM0 B, PWM1 A,
and so on.
• This pattern repeats for GPIOs 16 through 31. GPIO16 is PWM0 A, GPIO17 is PWM0 B, and so on up to PWM7 B on GPIO31.
GPIO30 and above are available only in the QFN-80 package.
• The remaining 8 PWM channels (4 × 2-channel slices) appear on GPIOs 32 through 39, and then repeat on GPIOs
40 through 47.
• If you select the same PWM output on two GPIO pins, the same signal appears on both.
• If you use B pin as an input and select it on multiple GPIO pins, the PWM slice sees the logical OR of those two
GPIO inputs.
NOTE
GPIOs 0 through 29 have the same channel assignment as RP2040 for pinout compatibility. This reduces the
maximum number of independent PWM outputs in the QFN-60 package option of RP2350, but you can still use
slices 8 through 11 for repeating timer interrupts in this package.
12.5.2.1. Pulse width modulation (PWM)
The PWM hardware continuously compares an input value to a free-running counter. This produces a toggling output;
the amount of time spent at the high output level corresponds to the input value. The fraction of time spent at the high
signal level is known as the duty cycle of the signal.
The counting period is controlled by the TOP register, with a maximum possible period of 65536 cycles, as the counter
and TOP are 16 bits in size. Use the CC register to configure input values.

Figure 112. The
counter repeatedly
counts from 0 to TOP,
forming a sawtooth
shape. The counter is
continuously
compared with some
input value. When the
input value is higher
than the counter, the
output is driven high.
Otherwise, the output
is low. The output
period T is defined by
the TOP value of the
counter, and how fast
the counter is
configured to count.
The average output
voltage, as a fraction
of the IO power
supply, is the input
value divided by the
counter period (TOP +
1)
This example shows the counting period and the A and B counter compare levels being configured on one of RP2350’s
PWM slices.

Figure 113. The slice
counts repeatedly
from 0 to 3, which is
configured as the TOP
value. The output
waves therefore have
a period of 4. Output A
is high for 1 cycle in 4,
so the average output
voltage is 1/4 of the
IO supply voltage.
Output B is high for 3
cycles in every 4. The
rising edges of A and
B are always aligned.
By default, PWM slices count upward until they reach the value of the TOP register. After they reach the TOP value, they
wrap to 0. Alternatively, set CSR_PH_CORRECT to 1 to enable phase-correct mode, where the counter counts downward after
reaching TOP, until it reaches 0 again.
Phase-correct mode centres the pulse on the same point no matter the duty cycle; its phase is not a function of duty
cycle. When phase-correct mode is enabled, the output frequency is halved. The slice spends two cycles at a count of
TOP and two cycles at a count of 0 each PWM period.

Figure 115. Glitch-free
0% duty cycle output
for CC = 0, and glitch-
free 100% duty cycle
output for CC = TOP +
1
A CC value of 0 produces a 0% output: the output signal is always low. A CC value of TOP + 1 (equal to the period when not
phase-corrected) produces a 100% output. If TOP is 254, the counter has a period of 255 cycles, and CC values in the
range of 0 to 255 inclusive will produce duty cycles in the range 0% to 100% inclusive.
Glitch-free output at 0% and 100% helps avoid switching losses, for instance, when a MOSFET is controlled at its
minimum and maximum current levels.
12.5.2.3. Double buffering
Figure 116 shows how a change in input value produces a change in output duty cycle. This can approximate analogue
waveforms such as a sine wave.

Figure 116. The input
value varies with each
counter period: first
TOP / 3, then 2 × TOP
/ 3, and finally TOP + 1
for 100% duty cycle.
Each increase in the
input value causes a
corresponding
increase in the output
duty cycle.
In Figure 116, the input value only changes at the instant where the counter wraps through 0. Figure 117 shows what
happens if the input value is allowed to change at any other time: an unwanted glitch is produced at the output.

Figure 117. The input
value changes whilst
the counter is mid-
ramp. This produces
additional toggling at
the output.
The behaviour becomes even more perplexing if the TOP register is also modified. It would be difficult for software to
write to CC or TOP with the correct timing. To solve this, each slice has two copies of the CC and TOP registers: one copy
that software can modify, and another, internal copy that is updated from the first register at the instant the counter
wraps. Software can modify its copy of the register at will, but the changes are not captured by the PWM output until the
next wrap.
Figure 118 shows the sequence of events where a software interrupt handler changes the value of CC_A each time the
counter wraps.

Figure 118. Each
counter wrap causes
the interrupt request
signal to assert. The
processor enters its
interrupt handler,
writes to its copy of
the CC register, and
clears the interrupt.
When the counter
wraps again, the
latched version of the
CC register is
instantaneously
updated with the most
recent value written by
software, and this
value controls the duty
cycle for the next
period. The IRQ is
reasserted so that
software can write
another fresh value to
its copy of the CC
register.
There is no limitation on what values can be written to CC or TOP, or when they are written. In normal PWM mode
(CSR_PH_CORRECT is 0), the latched copies update when the counter wraps to 0, which occurs once every TOP + 1 cycles. In
phase-correct mode (CSR_PH_CORRECT is 1), the latched copies update on the 0 to 0 count transition, when the counter
stops counting downward and begins to count upward again.
12.5.2.4. Clock divider
Each slice has a 8 integer bit, 4 fractional bit fractional clock divider configured by the DIV register. The clock divider
allows you to slow the count rate by a factor of up to 256. To do this, the PWM generates an enable signal that gates
counter operation. This allows you to achieve output frequencies significantly lower than the system clock. For
instance, from a 125MHz system clock, the clock divider can slow the count rate to approximately 7.5Hz. Lower
frequencies than this require a system timer interrupt (Section 12.8).

Figure 119. The clock
divider generates an
enable signal. The
counter only counts on
cycles where this
signal is high. A clock
divisor of 1 causes the
enable to be asserted
on every cycle, so the
counter counts by one
on every system clock
cycle. Higher divisors
cause the count
enable to be asserted
less frequently.
Fractional division
achieves an average
fractional counting
rate by spacing some
enable pulses further
apart than others.
The fractional divider is a first-order delta-sigma type.
The clock divider also extends the effective count range when using level-sensitive or edge-sensitive modes to take duty
cycle or frequency measurements.
12.5.2.5. Level-sensitive and edge-sensitive triggering
The PWM provides the following counter modes:
• Default free-running, counting continuously whenever the slice is enabled (free-running)
• Count continuously when a high level is detected on the B pin (level sensitive)
• Count once with each rising edge detected on the B pin (rising edge-sensitive)
• Count once with each falling edge detected on the B pin (falling edge-sensitive)

event selection. The
counter advances
when its enable input
is high. This enable is
generated by two
sequential stages.
First, any one of four
event types (always
on, pin B high, pin B
rise, pin B fall) can
generate enable
pulses for the
fractional clock
divider. The divider
can reduce the rate of
the enable pulses,
before passing them
on to the counter.
Use the DIVMODE field in each slice’s CSR to select a mode. In free-running mode, the A and B pins are both outputs. In any
other mode, the B pin becomes an input that controls counter operation. CC_B is ignored when not in free-running mode.
You can measure the duty cycle or frequency of an input signal by running the slice for a fixed amount of time in level-
sensitive or edge-sensitive mode. Due to the type of edge-detect circuit used, the low period and high period of the
measured signal must both be strictly greater than the system clock period when taking frequency measurements.
The clock divider still operates in level-sensitive and edge-sensitive modes. At maximum division (DIV_INT is 0), the
counter only advances once per 256 high input cycles in level-sensitive modes, or once per 256 edges in edge-sensitive
mode. This allows you to take longer-running measurements, although the resolution is still 16 bits.

35     float max_possible_count = counting_rate * 0.01;
36     return pwm_get_counter(slice_num) / max_possible_count;
37 }
12.5.2.6. Configuring PWM period
When free-running, use the following three parameters to control the period of a PWM slice’s output (measured in
system clock cycles):
• The TOP register, which controls the maximum value of the counting period
• The CSR_PH_CORRECT bit, which enables phase-correct mode
• The DIV register, which controls the clock divider
The slice counts from 0 to TOP, then either wraps or begins counting backward, depending on the setting of
CSR_PH_CORRECT. The clock divider slows the rate of counting, with a maximum speed of one count per cycle, and a
minimum speed of one count per 256 cycles. Calculate the period in clock cycles with the following equation:
RP2350 Datasheet
12.5. PWM
1083


To determine the output frequency based on the system clock frequency, use the following equation:
Set DIV_INT to 0 to divide the count rate by the maximum possible value of 256. You must not set any DIV_FRAC bits when
DIV_INT is 0.
12.5.2.7. Interrupt Request (IRQ) and DMA Data Request (DREQ)
The PWM block has two IRQ outputs. The interrupt status registers INTR, INTS0, INTS1, INTE0 and INTE1 allow software to:
• Control which slices assert each of the two IRQs
• Check which slices caused the assertion of an IRQ
• Clear and acknowledge the interrupt
A slice generates an interrupt request each time its counter wraps (or, in phase-correct mode, each time the counter
returns to 0). This sets the flag corresponding to this slice in the raw interrupt status register, INTR. If this slice’s interrupt
is enabled in INTE, this flag causes the PWM block’s IRQ to be asserted, and the flag also appears in the masked
interrupt status register INTS.
To clear flags, write a mask back to INTR. This is demonstrated in the LED fade SDK example below:

This scheme allows multiple slices to generate interrupts concurrently. A system interrupt handler determines which
slices caused the most recent interruption, and handles them appropriately. Normally, this means reloading those slices'
TOP or CC registers, but the PWM block can also be used as a source of regular interrupt requests for non-PWM purposes.
The same pulse which sets the interrupt flag in INTR is also available as a one-cycle data request to the RP2350 system
DMA. For each cycle the DMA sees a DREQ asserted, it makes one data transfer to its programmed location in as timely
a manner as possible. Combined with the double-buffered behaviour of CC and TOP, the DMA can efficiently stream data
to a PWM slice at a rate of one transfer per counter period. Alternatively, a PWM slice could serve as a pacing timer for
DMA transfers to some other memory-mapped hardware.
12.5.2.8. On-the-fly phase adjustment
For some applications, it is necessary to control the phase relationship between two PWM outputs on different slices.
The global enable register EN contains an alias of the CSR_EN flag for each slice. Use this register to start and stop several
slices simultaneously. If two slices with the same output frequency start at the same time, they run in perfect lockstep,
with a fixed phase relationship determined by the initial counter values.
The CSR_PH_ADV and CSR_PH_RET fields advance or retard a slice’s output phase by one count whilst it is running. They do so
by inserting or deleting pulses from the clock enable (the output of the clock divider), as shown in Figure 121.
