# 5.9.4. Partition table items

NOTE
The ROLLING_WINDOW_DELTA Item is ignored for non-flash binaries.
5.9.4. Partition table items
Partition tables allows dividing the 32 MB flash region (2 × 16 MB) into partitions. Permissions and other partition
attributes may be specified for each partition, along with permissions for the un-partitioned space.
The permission specify read/write access for Secure code, Non-secure code, and "NSBoot" which refers to the boot
loader (and PICOBOOT)
NOTE
These permissions are only advisory to Secure code, however they are respected by flash_op(), the PICOBOOT flash
access commands, and UF2 downloads.

5.9.4.2. Partition location, permissions, and flags
Two common words are stored in the partition table for both un-partitioned space and each partition. These common
words describe the size/location, along with access permissions and various flags.
The permission fields are repeated in both words, hence the two words are permissions_and_location and
permissions_and_flags.

'P'
FLAGS_HAS_ID_BITS
If set, the partition has a 64 bit identifier
0x00000006u
'P'
FLAGS_LINK_TYPE_BITS
The type of link stored in the partition:
• 0x0 - None
• 0x1 - A_PARTITION : This is a "B" partition, and The LINK_VALUE field stores the partition
number of the corresponding "A" partition
• 0x2 - OWNER : This is an "A" partition, and the LINK_VALUE field stores the partition number of
the owning partition (which should also be an "A" partition).
0x00000078u
'P'
FLAGS_LINK_VALUE_BITS
If LINK_TYPE is non zero, then this field holds the partition number of the linked partition.
0x00000180u
'P'
FLAGS_ACCEPTS_NUM_EXTRA_FAMILIES_BITS
0-3 the number of extra non-standard UF2 family ids the partition accepts.
0x00000200u
'P'
FLAGS_NOT_BOOTABLE_ARM_BITS
If set then this partition is marked non-bootable on Arm, and will be ignored during Arm boot.
Setting this for non Arm bootable partitions can improve boot performance.
0x00000400u
'P'
FLAGS_NOT_BOOTABLE_RISCV_BITS
If set then this partition is marked non-bootable on RISC-V, and will be ignored during RISC-V

FLAGS_ACCEPTS_DEFAULT_FAMILY_ABSOLUTE_BITS
If set for un-partitioned spaced, a UF2 with the ABSOLUTE family id 0xe48bff57 may be
downloaded onto the RP2350 and will be written at the addresses specified in the UF2 without
regard to partition locations. Partition-defined flash access permissions are still respected
(the UF2 download will fail if it needs to write over a read-only region of flash).
